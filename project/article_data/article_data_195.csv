Mike Pence says raising taxes lowers tax revenues
","On one side, we have David Stockman, the budget director for President Ronald Reagan. On the other, it's Rep. Mike Pence, the conservative Indiana Republican and potential presidential candidate. The venue: This Week with Christiane Amanpour. The topic: What's worse, raising taxes or letting the deficit run wild?

Stockman said the deficit could ruin the country and savaged the Republican Party's refusal to consider tax increases. ""Both parties, unfortunately, became free lunch parties, the Republicans cutting taxes every time they had a chance, never doing anything about spending, and the Democrats digging in to defend everything that was there,"" Stockman said. ""As a result, we now have this massive deficit. ... This will not end well. It's going to end in a disaster.""

Pence agreed that Republicans had wrongly allowed spending to increase during the George W. Bush administration but said that Republicans were now more committed to reducing government.

""We think we ought to go back to pre-stimulus, pre-bailout levels, and freeze there,"" Pence said. ""There's been an 84 percent increase in domestic spending since this administration took office. We've got to roll back there. That will save $100 billion in the first year. How about a net hiring freeze on Capitol Hill? ... For Americans under the age of 40, we've got to put everything on the table in the area of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. We have got to reform these entitlement programs. They are threatening the fiscal vitality of future generations of Americans.""

Not good enough, said Stockman: ""Social Security needs to be means-tested right now, not for benefits in 2030, right now, for the top one-third of beneficiaries who have private income that they've earned over their lifetime. We need to drastically scale back Medicare. And the Republicans expanded it. And I appreciate what Mike is saying, but there's no track record of a willingness to take on the doctors, the pharmaceutical companies, the scooter chair manufacturers, who are everywhere. (And) we need to take on defense ... We can't be the policemen of the world anymore because we can't afford it. We're going to have to cut defense drastically. And that isn't just fraud, waste and abuse. It's force structure, fewer divisions, fewer aircraft carriers. And even if we do all that, we still have to raise revenue.""

Raising revenue means a tax increase, which Pence said was a bad idea. And Pence further argued that a tax increase wouldn't help anyway: ""David believes that every tax increase equals a revenue increase, but that's not true. Anybody who is familiar with the historical data from the IRS knows that raising income tax rates will likely actually reduce federal revenues.""

That's what caught our attention as fact-checkers. How can raising taxes not raise money? And does the historical data really show that?

First, we should note that if you take Pence's statement at its most literal, it's not correct. The Internal Revenue Service has published detailed tables of tax collections, and they go up almost every year. They went up after tax increases passed in 1990 and 1993, and, when taxes were cut in 2001, collections dropped. But it's a bit more complicated than that.

If you're not an economist, it sounds counterintuitive to claim that raising taxes gets you less money, but there is some logic behind the theory. You have to start with the idea that government can tax people so much that it creates a disincentive to work. Let's start with an extreme: If you tax people at 100 percent -- which means you'd take all of their income -- people quit their jobs, and you'd get zero dollars in taxes. And rates that are close to 100 percent create similar disincentives. Back in 1980, for example, tax rates were much higher than they are now, with marginal tax rates on the highest incomes at 70 percent. Today, the top rate is half that -- 35 percent.

During the Reagan years, economists postulated that you could cut that top rate, which would stoke economic activity and produce more tax revenues. (You might remember terms such as supply-side economics or the Laffer curve that offer explanations for the theory.)  And this seems to be where Pence is coming from. During the 1980s, Reagan cut taxes, and tax revenues did go up almost every year.

But we consulted the tax experts, who told us you can't just look at the raw numbers, for several reasons. First, you should expect tax revenues to go up each year due to economic growth and inflation, even if tax rates stayed the same. Second, there's not a straight line between tax rates and tax revenues. You can raise taxes the same year the economy tanks and get less revenue, or you can cut taxes during a time of economic growth and get more revenue. And those changes in the economy aren't necessarily caused by what the government is doing with tax rates -- the upturns could be due to new inventions and innovations, and the downturns could result from financial panics and real estate bubbles that have little to do with tax rates. And economists have to go to quite a bit of trouble to separate out the effects of tax policy from other things happening in the world.

We also consulted a 2006 Treasury Department report that examined the revenue effects of major tax law changes since World War II. The report examined tax revenues generated by various tax law changes as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, a measurement that accounts for economic growth and inflation. The laws that reduced tax rates produced declines in revenues, and the laws that increased tax rates produced increases in tax revenues. So this too contradicts Pence's claim.

Interestingly, Stockman agreed with a little bit of Pence's underlying assumption that increases in taxes can inhibit economic growth. But he disagreed that tax revenues would decrease if the government raised taxes. ""I just have to respectfully disagree,"" Stockman said. ""You will have some loss of revenue because some activity or transactions won't happen, but if you raise taxes on paper by $100 billion, maybe you'll get $90 billion or $85 billion. But it's just common-sense fact that, when you raise the rates, you get more revenue. Normally, it's a bad thing to do. But we are in such dire shape that we have no choice but to accept the negative trade-off of some harm to the economy to start paying our bills.""

The tax experts we spoke with agreed with Stockman. In this climate, raising the top tax rates from 35 to 39.6 percent would increase revenues. The effect Pence is talking about would not happen at this level of taxation, they said.

""There is some rate at which it would be true,"" said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""But I don't think there are any established economists who would argue that we're near that.""

""At current tax rates, most tax increases will increase revenues, at least in the short and medium run,"" said Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""The caveat is that in a fragile economy, it can be unpredictable.""

""There is no real dispute among economists that broad-based federal income tax cuts reduce revenue (except when tax rates are much higher than they are now),"" said Alan D. Viard of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Revenue is lower than it would be without the Bush tax cuts -- liberal and conservative economists are in accord on this question.""

To recap, Pence said that, ""Anybody who is familiar with the historical data from the IRS knows that raising income tax rates will likely actually reduce federal revenues."" Actually, the historical data doesn't show that. Experts said the economic theory Pence is drawing from doesn't apply in the current situation, and an increase in tax rates would not cause tax revenues to decline. So we rate his statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/99d4f639-1c35-43e2-8ba7-3480dabc1ce7",[<zip object at 0x0000028097000600>],/factchecks/2010/nov/09/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-raising-taxes-lowers-tax-revenues/

Bill Nelson says feds are funding most of the proposed Tampa-Orlando rail line
","
Elected Democrats and Republicans are concerned that outsider Rick Scott's victory in the race for governor could doom a proposed high-speed rail line connecting Tampa and Orlando.

So they're coming to the defense of the $2.654 billion rail line by noting that construction of the proposed rail line would mostly be paid for with federal dollars.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson made the case to a group of 1,800 business leaders on Nov. 8, 2010, at an Orlando rail forum. ""Let's ask the governor-elect not to return the $2 billion in federal funds the state so desperately needs,"" Nelson said.

""The amount of the revenue required by the state is around 10 percent,"" Nelson said. ""It could be one of the biggest boosts to the Florida economy since the location of Disney and the interstate highway system.""

Republican state Sen. Paula Dockery, a Scott adviser and rail supporter, also has said she hoped Scott would move forward with the rail project, noting that the project is estimated to create 5,000 jobs during the four-year construction period and that the rail line would employ 600-1,000 people once operational, and other spin-off jobs.

We can't check the job creation figures, since they are estimates, but we can assess Nelson's claim that the state is on the hook for only around 10 percent of the cost to build the line.

But first a little bit about the line itself, and why people are concerned Scott might kill the Tampa-to-Orlando project.

Construction on the 85-mile rail line would link downtown Tampa with the Orlando International Airport and would begin in earnest in 2012 and be completed in 2015. The rail line would have five stations mainly along Interstate 4, and would include stops in Polk County, near Disney World and at the Orange County Convention Center.

Plans call for purchasing five trains capable of holding 250 passengers that could make the entire trip in less than an hour at speeds of at least 168 mph. According to the state, a one-way trip from Tampa-Orlando is anticipated to cost $30 as a one-time fare, or less for regular users.

The state also has plans for an $8 billion Orlando-Miami line, though no funding is in place.

Scott has questioned the rail line publicly, first attacking his Democratic gubernatorial opponent Alex Sink for supporting the line without addressing how she'd pay for it, then saying the true cost to the state is unknown. Here's what he had to say about rail during the Oct. 25, 2010, CNN/St. Petersburg Times debate:

""Every project we do, we have to get return for taxpayers,"" Scott said. ""So, the way I look at it, on the high-speed rail, if the federal government is going to fund all of it, and there's no -- there's nothing the state -- going to cost the state any money, let's look at it. But let's look at a final feasibility study. Let's look at exactly what the state is responsible for. But if you're going to build an office building, you wouldn't ... go build half of it with the money and wait and see, hopefully, somebody is going to show up with the rest. We shouldn't be doing that with any projects like rail.

""Let's make sure we have all of the money. Let's do a final feasibility study. Let's actually look at what the real return is,"" Scott added, saying he would put a hold on the project until he had all the data he needed.

The fear from Nelson and others that Scott might kill the rail project was made more real when newly elected Republican governors in Wisconsin and Ohio said that they wanted to end rail projects in their states, saying the projects are a money pit.

So how is the Tampa-Orlando line being paid for?

In January, President Barack Obama announced that the rail line will receive $1.25 billion in federal stimulus dollars. Then in October, the federal government announced it was directing another $800 million to the project in transportation funds. As part of the $800 million award, the state pledged a match of $280 million. That's a total of $2.33 billion already committed to the project -- leaving a funding gap of around $325 million.

Nazih Haddad, chief operating officer for the state Transportation Department's Florida Rail Enterprise, said the gap will hopefully be filled by additional federal dollars, or potentially private sector investment.

""At this time, the state's contribution is limited to $280 million,"" Haddad said.

If that's the case, the state will contribute $280 million for the construction of the $2.654 billion Tampa-Orlando line, or 10.55 percent. (So far it has pledged 12 percent of the $2.33 billion committed).

The caveat, of course, is that the percentage neglects to account for how the remainder of the line will be funded. If the state was forced to pick up the rest of the costs, the state's share would rise to 22.8 percent. If the state was asked to pick up half of the remaining costs, the percentage contribution would increase to 16.7 percent. A quarter of the additional cost translates to a 13.6 percent share. And so on.

State and federal officials, including Nelson, predict the federal government will fund much if not all of the cost remaining. But we're not willing to write the money off as a foregone conclusion. Haddad correctly clarified Nelson's comments. ""If we are able to obtain the remaining money from federal sources, the total federal share will be approximately 90 percent with the state's share of a little over 10 percent,"" he said.

Now, since we're talking about money, a quick word on the operation of the train.

State officials say they will seek a partnership with a private operator to maintain and run the system, with each side sharing some of the risk. Still, the state estimates the system will turn a profit in its first year of operation. The system will cost $164,000 a day to run, but will generate $170,000 a day in revenues, and about 5,400 riders daily. (These, again, are figures we can't check since they're projections and estimates. Also, no word on how any profit would be shared).

Back to Nelson's claim. He said the amount of revenue required by the state to build the Tampa-Orlando high-speed rail line is ""around 10 percent."" Nelson's point is largely right. The federal government to date has pledged $2.05 billion to the line compared to $280 million from the state. That puts the state on the hook for about 12 percent of the costs so far. But there is still a $325 million or so hole that needs to be filled. Depending on how the state, the federal government and possibly the private sector split that cost, the state's share could increase, or decrease. Until those checks are written, we think it's appropriate to rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097455100>],/factchecks/2010/nov/09/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-feds-are-funding-most-proposed-ta/
"['Ohio', 'Consumer Safety', 'Financial Regulation', 'John Boehner']","
John Boehner on point in describing new regulations in consumer protection law
","The morning after Republicans won House of Representatives control in last weeks’ elections, soon-to-be House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio held a news conference where he outlined upcoming GOP priorities for the next Congress.

How about those tax cuts implemented under President Bush? He wants to keep ’em!

What about the health care reform bill adopted under President Obama? He wants it repealed!

The congressman from West Chester was more circumspect when asked about potential changes to a financial services reform package adopted earlier this year, promising merely to exercise oversight over its implementation.

The law, signed by Obama in July, established an independent consumer bureau within the Federal Reserve to protect borrowers against abuses in mortgage, credit card and some other types of lending. It also gave government new power to seize and shut down large, troubled financial companies.

""I think when it comes to the financial services bill and the 358 regulatory filings required under that bill, that it’s going to require a significant amount of oversight, so that not only will Congress understand, but the American people will understand, just what this bill will do to our financial services industry,"" Boehner answered.

That sounded like an awful lot of regulatory filings, so we asked Boehner’s office where his statistic came from. Staffers pointed to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce website
that expresses the group’s dismay with the legislation:

""The Financial Regulatory Reform bill doesn't address the core causes of the financial crisis,"" it says. ""Instead, it adds new regulatory agencies to the already antiquated system and grows a bloated, ineffective bureaucracy while leaving critical areas unaddressed, including the future of Freddie and Fannie. The real impact of the bill will depend on its implementation. The legislation requires regulators to issue at least 355 new rules and conduct 47 studies and 74 reports that could lead to additional rules.""

That’s not exactly Boehner’s number, but it’s close enough.

A July 15 news release from the Chamber goes even further, citing a study that says the bill creates 533 required regulatory rulemakings, 60 studies, and 93 reports.

A spokesman for Senate Banking Committee chairman Chris Dodd of Connecticut confirmed the bill imposes more regulation on Wall Street, but said the committee has not tallied up the exact number. He didn’t dispute Boehner’s statistics..

""These regulations are long overdue,"" said Dodd spokesman Sam Gilford. ""The financial crisis occurred because there were gaps in the regulations.""

Democrats cite a recent Gallup Poll to explain why Boehner said he’d exercise oversight over the financial services bill rather than seek its repeal. The poll found that six in 10 Americans approve of the legislation, in contrast to the majority that disapprove of 2009 economic stimulus package, the auto industry bailout, health care reform, and -- most of all -- the 2008 banking industry bailout.

So, while Boehner’s 358 might not be right on the money, his underlying point is correct. The new law does create a lot of new regulations for the financial services industry.

We find Boehner’s statement to be True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966D0C00>],/factchecks/2010/nov/09/john-boehner/john-boehner-point-describing-new-regulations-cons/

George Allen says national debt increased $6 trillion under Obama
","
Former U.S. Sen. George Allen recently ripped Democrats for growing government and exploding the national debt.

""Election Day 2010 saw the culmination of years of aggravation and resentment toward a federal government that became disconnected and disdainful of the values and priorities of Americans,"" Allen wrote in a Nov. 5 Op/Ed in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""People are rightfully riled by bailouts of failed automobile manufacturers, health care dictates, energy restrictions, and the unprecedented expansion of government spending and dangerous debt -- nearly $6 trillion more than when President Obama was sworn into office.""

Whoa. Did he say $6 trillion more in debt? Since January 2009? That’s a statistic we hadn’t heard before. So we decided to look into it.

According to the U.S. Treasury, the total national debt as of Jan. 31, 2009 -- 11 days after President Obama took office -- was $10.6 trillion. So, in order for Allen’s claim to be true on its face, the current publicly held debt would have to be about $16.6 trillion.

Well, is it?

Nope, not even close. The publicly held debt as of Oct. 31 was $13.7 trillion, almost $3 trillion short of Allen’s claim.

Asked for a source, Tim Nussbaum, Allen’s executive assistant, cited an Oct. 18 CBS News report on the nation’s rising debt.

That report also finds that the debt has risen by almost $3 trillion, but adds: ""The administration has projected the national debt will soar in Mr. Obama's fourth year in office to nearly $16.5-trillion in 2012. That's more than 100 percent of the value of the nation's economy and $5.9-trillion above what it was his first day on the job."" 

To check that, we turned to the Office of Management and Budget to to look at future debt estimates based on the current fiscal 2011 budget.

If $16.335 trillion qualifies as ""nearly $16.5 trillion,"" then the CBS report is right.

But is Allen? Let’s take a look back to decide.  

Allen’s language in the Op/Ed plainly implies the Obama administration's actions have already caused the debt to rise $6 trillion. That’s simply wrong. The debt has risen by $3.1 trillion since Obama took office.

For that reason, we find Allen’s claim to be False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097911C80>],/factchecks/2010/nov/09/george-allen/george-allen-says-national-debt-increased-6-trilli/

Scott Walker has shifted tone on highway tolls
","
For as long as there have been roads in Wisconsin, the notion of rigging them with tolls has been only slightly less popular than, say, abolishing deer hunting.

Badger State motorists turn red with ire every time they head down I-94 toward Chicago and have to scrounge for change.

So, it was notable late in the 2010 campaign when Governor-elect Scott Walker expressed support for certain tolls. The Republican nominee assured voters he didn’t back full-fledged toll roads that require all motorists to pay. Rather, he was open to adding a faster-moving lane to freeways that drivers would pay a toll to use. That is, toll lanes.

""I don't support tolls,"" Walker said in an Oct. 23, 2010, article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""Tolls are where you have no options (on paying). I oppose tolls today just as much as I did in 2004.""

In 2004, Walker was running for re-election as Milwaukee County executive. He promised not only to block any toll ways but also any new fees.

All of which means it’s time to break out the Flip-O-Meter, which we use to determine whether someone has flip-flopped on an issue.

Walker’s support for toll lanes drew at least two accusations of flip-flopping in the days before the Nov. 2 election. One came from Democratic challenger Tom Barrett, who created a website called www.notolltax.com. Another came in a radio ad from the Greater Wisconsin Political Fund, an arm of the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee.

So, let’s sort this out, using a timeline of Walker’s statements.

2004: During his re-election campaign for county executive, Walker distributed a flier promising voters he would do 10 things, one being:""Block any attempt to increase taxes or create new fees, including toll ways.""

So: Not only no toll roads, but no to any new fees.  

Feb. 19, 2009: Two months before announcing his campaign for governor, Walker reacted to news that Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle would be open to charging tolls on state highways, possibly for express lanes. Walker said he was generally opposed to tolls, but that the concept of a so-called HOT lane was worth discussing. High-occupancy toll lanes give motorists the option of paying a toll to use a less congested lane. In some places, drivers who have one or more passengers can use the HOT lanes without paying.

So: Opposed to toll roads, but open to toll lanes, which would create a new fee for those who want to use them.

Aug. 6, 2010: In a debate, Walker repeated his opposition to toll roads. But in an interview, he said he was open to allowing drivers to pay to use express lanes.

Again, opposed to toll roads, but open to toll lanes and the fees that go with them.

Oct. 19, 2010: Walker told the Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin he supports putting tolls on new highway express lanes.

That was the move that prompted news stories and the flip-flop cries from opponents.

So, where has this historical drive taken us?

Walker has consistently opposed traditional toll roads, but as toll lanes emerged as an option, he embraced them in concept and finally endorsed them. In arguing he has not flipped on the issue, Walker actually provides some additional evidence he has at least twisted a bit: His 2004 promises list included a pledge not to create any new fees, but his support for toll lanes amounts to a user fee to drivers who want to use the faster lane.

In our estimation, with his position on tolls, Walker has done a Half-Flip.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979E0600>],/factchecks/2010/nov/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-has-shifted-tone-highway-tolls/
"['Georgia', 'Guns', 'Michael Bloomberg']","
Bloomberg gun claim takes aim at Georgia
","
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently took aim at the Peach State.

Bloomberg was on CNN several weeks ago to discuss a report that named Georgia among the states with the weakest gun laws.

""Do the states where they have weaker laws have more crime?"" asked CNN's Kiran Chetry.

""There's no argument about that,"" Bloomberg replied.

National Rifle Association spokeswoman Rachel Parsons called Bloomberg's claim ""absolutely ridiculous.""

""If that were the case, Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York would be some of the safest cities in our country, and they are simply not,"" Parsons said. ""Yet, they have some of the strictest gun laws in the country.""

The nation's capital had a higher violent crime rate than any of the 50 states in each of the past three years, according to FBI data. New York was at the other end of the spectrum, the data showed. The Big Apple had the lowest crime rate among the nation's 25 largest cities, the FBI data showed.

But Bloomberg answered a question about states, so let's dig into his claim a little deeper.

The report, ""Trace the Guns: The Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun Trafficking,"" was put together for a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns and completed in September. Bloomberg, an independent, is co-chair of the coalition. Georgia mayors listed as coalition members include Atlanta's Kasim Reed, East Point's Earnestine Pittman, Roswell's Jere Wood and Savannah's Otis Johnson.

Ten states, half of them located in the South, are listed in the report as having weak gun laws. They are Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia.

Bloomberg, a vocal advocate of gun control, filed lawsuits against eight gun shops in Georgia and in 19 other states in 2006 he argued had relatively lax gun laws. Most of the cases were settled. Others defaulted, and a couple of cases were dismissed.

Researchers looked at several topics concerning violence and where the guns came from that were used in the crimes, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In each of the past four years, the report found Georgia led the nation in the number of guns sold here that were used in crimes in other states.Per capita, Georgia was 10th on the list. The researchers reached that conclusion by dividing the number of guns sold by 100,000 residents. Mississippi was first.New York ranked next to last on the list, ahead of Hawaii.

The report contains a checklist of 10 ""key gun laws"" and which states have passed those laws and which ones have not to determine which states have weak gun laws.

The laws include whether a state requires background checks for all handgun sales at gun shows, if the state prohibits gun possession by violent misdemeanantsand whether the state requires reporting of lost or stolen guns. Georgia has enacted two of the 10 laws. Georgia requires state inspection of gun dealers. Gun dealers who don’t conduct background checks of prospective gun owners can go to jail.

Some groups, such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation, have criticized the findings, saying crime has ""plummeted"" in states said in the study to have weaker gun laws.

We reviewed two sets of data to see whether Bloomberg is correct about states that have weak gun laws still have more crime. One supported his argument; the other one offered mixed results.

The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps track of firearm deaths by state. Eight of the 10 states said to have ""weak"" gun laws were in the top half of states with firearm deaths, according to the most recent CDC figures. The most recent figures, from 2007, were adjusted for population. The results were similar from 2003 to 2006. Georgia ranked between 14th and 20th during those five years.

We also looked at the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, which show violent crime rates for each state and Washington, D.C. Five of the states said to have ""weak"" gun laws were in the top half of states of violent crime in 2009. Georgia ranked 20th. Washington, D.C., was first; its violent crime rate was more than twice any state on the list. The results were similar in 2008 and 2007. The FBI warns against using the data to make comparisons, noting they don't take into account variables that might impact a state's crime rate.

Harvard University's Department of Health Policy and Management tracks firearm research, frequently does reports on the subject and is considered experts in this field. We talked to two members of its faculty, Matt Miller and David Hemenway, about Bloomberg's answer to the question during the CNN interview. Both men have done studies on similar subjects and believe there is a correlation between places with more guns and homicide.

""Where there are more guns, there are more deaths and homicides,"" Miller said.

They said there's less research and data on whether states with weaker gun laws have more crime or states with more guns have higher crime rates.

""Most crimes don't involve guns,"" Hemenway said. ""If there's causation at all, it's not clear.""

So where does this leave us? The CDC numbers do show states with weaker gun laws tend to have more firearm deaths. The FBI data shows some of those states had more violent crime, but others were in the middle of the pack nationally. There are many types of crime, and not all are committed with firearms. We rate Bloomberg's statement as a Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979E0C00>],/factchecks/2010/nov/09/michael-bloomberg/bloomberg-gun-claim-takes-aim-georgia/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Military', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Rand Paul']","
Rand Paul says that federal interest burden will approach cost of defense spending in a ""couple of years""
","
As one of the highest-profile Tea Party candidates of 2010, Rand Paul made reducing federal spending a centerpiece of his successful campaign for a Senate seat from Kentucky.

In a Nov. 7, 2010, appearance on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Paul -- who easily defeated Democrat Jack Conway on Election Day -- suggested the debt is growing to staggering levels.

""The interest on the debt now is going to approach in the next couple of years -- just the interest on the debt -- will approach what we spend in the national defense budget,"" Paul said.

We hadn't heard that comparison before, so we wanted to check it out. The first place we turned to was a historical table in the president's budget proposal for 2011. (Budget geeks will know it as Table 3.1: ""Outlays by Superfunction and Function: 1940–2015."") Among the categories in this table are amounts for national defense spending and for net interest owed by the federal government.

The defense spending figure begins at $719 billion for 2010, then rises a bit before declining to $685 billion in 2015.

The net interest figure is smaller to start, but it rises more quickly. It starts at $188 billion in 2010, but ends up at $571 billion in 2015. That's roughly a tripling in five years.

If you compare the two figures year by year, you find that in 2010, net interest is equivalent to 26 percent of defense spending. That percentage rises to 33 percent for 2011, 50 percent for 2012, 66 percent for 2013, 76 percent for 2014 and 83 percent for 2015.

Paul has certainly characterized the general trendline correctly: Through 2015, net interest climbs closer and closer to the level of defense spending. But whether this counts as ""in the next couple of years"" -- and how close the percentage has to get to qualify as ""approach(ing) ... what we spend in the national defense budget"" -- is more of a judgment call. He would be more acccurate if he said 5 to 6 years instead of  ""couple of years"" and relied on 90 percent as the threshold for ""approaching."" But both terms Paul used might be elastic enough to cover the numbers we found.

We will add that these figures are projections that may or may not come to pass, depending on what happens with the economy, policy changes, and military threats over the next decade. And we'll note that we're using the statistic called net interest, which includes interest owed the public, not interest that the government owes itself. If we used gross interest instead, the amount of interest would be higher, making interest a higher proportion of defense spending in each year. But the economists we spoke to said the best statistic to use for this evaluation is the smaller, net interest figure, so we'll stick with that one.

A Paul spokesman, Doug Stafford, added that ""interest rates are historically low. There is no reason to believe that will continue. If they edged up to anywhere near historically average numbers, the interest on the debt would skyrocket as a percentage of the budget and would do so very rapidly.""

The economists we spoke to said that's a valid concern, but we won't use it to grade Paul's statement on This Week, since it's based on speculation.

So let's put it all together. Paul is correct to point out the coming explosion in net interest payments -- a level that will rise steadily in comparison to defense spending over the next decade as defense spending falls modestly. He's a bit too aggressive when he says the interest burden will ""approach ... what we spend in the national defense budget"" in ""the next couple of years."" It will probably do so by 2015 or 2016, which would be the final two years of Barack Obama's second term, if he wins one. For a president who just survived his first midterm election, that seems pretty far away. Still, even if Paul's time span is slightly exaggerated, we don't think it's a fatal error, since his point about the trend is accurate. So we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFB55D80>],/factchecks/2010/nov/08/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-federal-interest-burden-will-approa/

Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle says 10 percent of public school teachers would have lost their jobs without federal stimulus aid
","
Lame-duck governor Jim Doyle’s low popularity rating among Wisconsin voters guaranteed he would keep a low profile while Tom Barrett fought -- unsuccessfully -- to keep a Democrat in charge in Madison.

But that doesn’t mean Doyle was silent.

In mid-October, Doyle was showcased on a BBC NewsHour radio feature that asked whether the United States needed a second shot of stimulus money from Washington.

Not surprisingly, Doyle defended President Barack Obama and blamed Republicans for creating an enormous fiscal mess that demanded an unpopular but necessary response -- the giant stimulus bill OK’d in early in 2009.

Doyle said stimulus grants helped keep schools functioning well, boosted road projects and showered funds on University of Wisconsin medical researchers. And he talked of how he has tried to sell the public on the measure’s positive impact:

Said Doyle: ""I say to people, ‘You want to see stimulus money at work you should go to the (local) public school … about every 10th teacher wouldn’t be teaching there if we hadn’t had the help that came from President Obama.’ ""

With all the controversy over jobs saved and created, did the stimulus money really save 1 in 10 teacher jobs in Wisconsin?

We’ll put our pencil to this test.

In making the claim, Doyle points to a federal report that says there were 9,922 education jobs funded by federal stimulus cash. That represents about 1 in 10 of the 105,000 public school employees in the most recent state figures.

Of course, that refers to all employees, not just teachers -- the first wrinkle in a calculation that is  a lot trickier than 2 + 2 = 4.

Other considerations: The reporting to the federal government on jobs created and saved by stimulus money doesn’t break down the type of position. Some of the reporting requirements have changed and aren’t very useful for drawing judgments about the real world impact.

Let’s start with the overall numbers.

Near the end of the 2009-’10 school year, the state reported 9,922 jobs were being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (commonly known as the stimulus package).

Doyle acknowledges that those numbers include support staff and others -- not strictly teachers. His policy director, Christopher Patton, says it’s reasonable to conclude that ratio for teachers in the group of jobs saved is the same as that for all employees.

But there is no way to know for sure -- the feds didn’t require that level of detail from school districts.

There’s another hitch: The biggest chunk by far of the education funding in the stimulus was sent to local districts in two different school years -- 2008-’09 and 2009-’10, according to the state Department of Public Instruction and various local school officials. That dough came in two uneven chunks a year apart, and totaled a whopping $717 million.

Thus, some was spent to preserve jobs in the first year and some in the second year. Some districts applied it to teachers salaries, some put it toward other workers -- including bus drivers at Milwaukee Public Schools in 2009-’10.

Some of the money didn’t go to salaries at all. It went to pay the bills.

So, if you visit a school -- as Doyle’s scenario suggests -- not all of those jobs were saved in the current year. In fact, some may have essentially been saved from layoff twice.

There is no way to say how many. The federal reporting requirements, which Doyle is citing, lumped them all into one year.

Even if you accept Doyle’s premise that nearly 10 percent of teachers were funded by stimulus, it’s far from certain they would have been laid off without it.

Some districts might have been forced to contemplate layoffs, but more likely they would have dipped into reserve funds or found other ways to save some or all of the jobs. That’s according to two people on the front lines: Emily Koczela and Mark Boehlke, business managers for Brown Deer and Shorewood schools, respectively.

Part of the reason: timing.

Both stimulus payments were received toward the end of school years, when layoffs were virtually unthinkable. And, according to Koczela and Boehlke, it was likely too late at that point to break teachers’ contracts for the following school year.

There are other, smaller stimulus-related pots of funding for education that more clearly saved jobs than did the $717 million. For instance, Koczela said some special education teachers likely faced layoff without those allocations.

So, Doyle’s statement is based on actual numbers, but makes an assumption that cannot be proven and faces some practical realities that suggest it is off base.

Patton, Doyle’s policy director, said the fact remains that 9,922 jobs were funded through the federal help. And he argued that the sheer size of the federal aid to state schools makes it common sense that teachers would have been in harm’s way.

""When you look at $800 million in aid to schools, it’s pretty hard to imagine those types of reductions that would not result in larger class sizes and less teachers in schools,"" he said.

But we’re left with the numbers, and how Doyle used them in the BBC interview.

To illustrate his point about the benefit of stimulus funding, Doyle argues that 1 in 10 public school teachers -- out of some 60,000 in the state -- would be out of work without the stimulus money. But his math is based on an assumption that teachers would have been targeted at the same proportion as support staff and ignores the practical realities of how the money came in during two budget years, which means some of the jobs may have been saved twice.

We rate Doyle’s statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097724DC0>],/factchecks/2010/nov/08/jim-doyle/wisconsin-gov-jim-doyle-says-10-percent-public-sch/

Rick Perry says Washington's reach extends to telling us which light bulb to use
","
No duh, Gov. Rick Perry has a thing against things from Washington. His new book, ""Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington,"" brims with what-the-hey statements about whassup in our nation's capital including a declaration that lit us up.

Saying there's ""no end to the reach of Washington,"" Perry writes that Washington is ""even telling us what kind of light bulb we can use.""

We asked Perry for backup on that claim and didn't hear back. Then we launched a search for ""use-this-bulb"" regulations.

What we found: In 2007, Congress voted to improve the efficiency of light bulbs. President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which set energy efficiency standards for kinds of incandescent lamps (light bulbs), incandescent reflector lamps (like track lighting in your kitchen), and fluorescent lamps, according to a December 2007 summary by the Congressional Research Service. With a few exceptions, the law also prohibits the U.S Coast Guard from purchasing incandescent light bulbs for use in Coast Guard office buildings.

Barack Obama, Bush's successor, promised while running for president to to sign a measure into law that ""begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs."" He said the change would save Americans $6 billion a year on their electric bills. Last year, PolitiFact reported that no such proposal was made it into law, though in June 2009 Obama announced changes in lighting standards. Starting in August 2012, fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps must become more efficient. The government said such fluorescent and incandescent lamps represented approximately 38 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of total lighting energy use.

Our search for instances of the government directing which bulbs residents can use unearthed a June 2010 editorial in the Washington Times objecting to Federal Trade Commission-issued regulations of light-bulb labels. The editorial says the regs were ordered by Congress as part of its 2007 decision to force the more efficient, curlicue-shaped compact fluorescent light bulb ""on a public that so far has refused to embrace it willingly. Beginning Jan. 1, 2012, the editorial says, bureaucratic rules will phase in, and"" conventional 100-watt bulbs ""will be first on the contraband list.""

Make sense?

Jen Stutsman, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Energy, told us that conventional incandescent bulbs are not expected to meet the efficiency standards Congress set, though the government expects manufacturers to improve incandescent technologies to meet the higher standards or consumers will move to compact fluorescent light bulbs, LED technologies or halogens. She said new standards for 100-watt bulbs take effect in January 2012. New standards for 75-watt bulbs start in 2013 and standards for 60- and 40-watt bulbs start in 2014.

Stutsman said the expected shifts aren't equivalent to the government telling Americans which light bulbs to use. ""Under no circumstances does it say that a consumer must purchase a specific type of light bulb,"" Stutsman said.

Finally, we sought advice from the Dallas-based American Lighting Association, a trade group whose director of engineering and technology, Terry McGowan, said in an e-mail that it's a stretch to say federal laws are telling us what light bulb to buy. ""Federal law is requiring that household light bulbs be made more efficient in steps over time as a nationwide energy-saving measure. It's like saying that new cars will have to deliver more miles/gallon. Maybe some people would say that's mandating what kind of car to buy; but that's an interpretation — especially if many cars on the market can meet the miles/gallon requirement,"" McGowan said.

""There will still be household light bulbs available,"" McGowan's e-mail says, noting later that special-purpose bulbs used in appliances or for decorative purposes are exempted. ""One thing is for sure; what we use for lighting our homes will take some thought — and maybe we'll be changing what we decide to do.""

So, is Washington telling us what kind of bulb to use?

Not yet, though the 2007 law steps up efficiency requirements and that's expected to result in consumers purchasing and using different bulbs. These factors give Perry's statement an element of truth. We rate it Barely True.
  
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DC0840>],/factchecks/2010/nov/08/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-washingtons-reach-extends-telling-/
"['Georgia', 'Children', ""Children's Healthcare of Atlanta""]","
Hospital says Georgia's kids second-fattest in nation
","
The news was enough to make the AJC PolitiFact Georgia scribe toss her leftover Halloween candy corn to the squirrels.

""Georgia has the second-highest rate of childhood obesity in the United States,"" said a recent news release from Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, a hospital that specializes in pediatric care.

Second? Out of all the states in the union? Are Georgia kids really that hefty?
 
Yes, we felt guilty. One PolitiFact Georgia reporter had spent a recent afternoon dressed as a witch, handing out fistfuls of sweets to trick-or-treaters. 

Childhood obesity can lead to diabetes, high cholesterol and other potentially deadly problems. It also places more burdens on the health care system.

We called a spokeswoman for Children's Healthcare Atlanta, who pointed us to ""F as in Fat,"" a report issued by the Trust for America's Health, a nonprofit group that specializes in disease prevention.

Sure enough, there Georgia was, second only to Mississippi in 2007 for obesity rates among 10- to 17-year-olds. In this state, 21.3 percent of children were obese, the report said. Mississippi's rate was 21.9 percent.

The report defined an ""obese"" child as one with a body mass index greater than the 95th percentile for his age group.

For instance, a 10-year-old boy with a height of 4 foot 6 inches and weighing 100 pounds would be obese. That's because his body mass index is 24.1, which is in the 97th percentile of his age group.  

Of the 10 states with the highest childhood obesity rates, nine were in the South, the report said.  

Children in Western states tended to be far more svelte. Eight of the 10 states with the lowest obesity rates were located in that region.

The trust used figures from the National Survey of Children's Health, an effort funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The telephone survey asks parents for their children's ages, races, genders, weights and heights.

Almost all the state-by-state rankings we found were based on data from that same survey. Understandably, they came up with similar results. 

The National Kids Count Program, run by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, used the same data to rank Georgia third in 2007. 

Its analysis ranked a slightly different group of kids: the number of children age 10-17 who are overweight as well as obese. Those are children whose body mass index is above the 85th percentile for their age and gender.

A set of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided different results, but this survey was far from comparable. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System asks high school students in grades nine through 12 to report whether they are obese.

The CDC does not rank states by high school obesity rates, but the data show that in 2009, 12.4 percent of Georgia high schoolers said they were obese. That's the 19th-highest of the states. But again, high schoolers report their own weight for this survey, and they might not be as accurate as their parents.

The CDC does conduct a survey in which children are measured in person, but it doesn't break down the data by state.

Why are Georgia's kids so heavy? We could locate no studies that answer that question, but there are some hints.

The children who are at the highest risk for obesity are minorities or from rural areas, and they make up a large proportion of the state's child population, said Marsha Davis, a professor at the University of Georgia who studies childhood obesity.

In rural areas, parents have trouble getting to supermarkets that sell fruits and vegetables. They end up feeding children with junk food they find at gas station convenience stores.

For instance, the agricultural industry in South Georgia's Colquitt County ships produce across the country but sells very little locally, Davis said. The obesity rate there is extremely high.

So while there is some variance in what surveys tell us, there's widespread agreement that Georgia kids are obese. And by one widely respected measure, Georgia's kids are the second-most obese in the nation. 

Now, that's not to say you need to throw out your kid's stash of Halloween candy.

""Halloween is fun,"" Davis said. ""The problem is we're having Halloween every day.""

"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Virginia', 'Eric Cantor']","
Eric Cantor says President Obama's budget adds more debt than totaled by 43 previous presidents
","
Rep. Eric Cantor, R-7th, recently had his pants set afire by PolitiFact Virginia for the following statement on Comedy Central's Daily Show with Jon Stewart:

""What you've seen (in Washington),"" he said, ""is a crowd that has taken advantage of a crisis back in late '08, early '09 and spent more money than this country has spent in the last 200 years combined, in the two years since.""

In a Richmond Times-Dispatch letter to the editor days after the PolitiFact rating, Cantor owned up to misspeaking and clarified his remarks.  

""What I meant to say was that the budget submitted by Obama will add more to the debt than the outstanding debt of the previous 43 presidents combined,"" he wrote.

Well, is that true?

We decided to take a look.

First, it bears mentioning that Cantor’s revised statement does two things: it changes the focus from spending to accumulated public debt and does away with the two-year timeline. That changes things considerably.

Asked for a source for the adjusted claim, a spokeswoman for Cantor pointed to statistics on publicly held debt from the Office of Management and Budget.

According to those figures, the debt from the nation's birth through the end of 2008 -- George Washington through George W. Bush --  was $5.8 trillion.

Now, had Cantor stuck with the original timeline of two years, we would need to limit our look at the increase in public federal debt between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010, which has been almost $3.5 trillion. That would make the claim false by a long shot.

But by leaving the date open ended, we are left to determine for ourselves when and if the Obama administration’s budget would double the $5.8 trillion in debt accumulated through the end of fiscal 2008.

Well, according to the OMB’s fiscal year 2011 budget projections, that would occur at the end of fiscal 2012, when the debt is expected to reach $11.6 trillion.

In fiscal 2013, the last budget assembled during President Barack Obama's first term, debt is expected to reach $12.5 trillion.

So, let’s take a look back.

Cantor’s clarifications altered the original claim in two ways: focusing on publicly held debt instead of spending and not limiting the timeline to two years from Obama taking office.

As a result, the claim adds up since the $5.8 trillion of debt accumulated in the U.S. to date is projected to double by 2012, or three years after Obama took office.

Of course, whether this will happen is another matter entirely, as new budgets with new projections are adopted each year. Nonetheless, Cantor’s claim works based on the most recent numbers available and we therefore find it to be True.

"['Federal Budget', 'Stimulus', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan says U.S. discretionary spending increased 84 percent in the last two years
","
U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican, and incoming chairman of the House Budget Committee, is known for his mastery of math and fondness for figures.

In one notable episode, Ryan directly confronted President Barack Obama at an open meeting of House Republicans in Baltimore in January 2010.
.
""The spending bills that you have signed into law, the domestic discretionary spending has been increased by 84 percent,"" Ryan told the president, in the televised exchange.

Obama pushed back on the number, and the wonky episode might otherwise have been forgotten, but Republican candidates and incoming House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio repeated similar claims through the fall election.

Most recently, Ryan was again quoted as saying it by the Racine Journal Times in the wake of the Nov. 2 election: ""Discretionary spending went up 84 percent in the last two years.""

That’s a big increase.

And, with Ryan set to take over the House Budget Committee, one worth sorting out.

The backup for his claim can be found in a June 4, 2010 news release issued in the name of the budget committee’s Republican caucus.

In it, Ryan makes clear he is talking about non-defense discretionary spending. Discretionary spending goes for such things as education, health and housing -- in contrast to mandatory expenditures such as Social Security and Medicare ""entitlements.""

Outside experts that PolitiFact Wisconsin spoke with quibble a bit about the annual budget figures Ryan uses, but the numbers are not really in dispute. And they do show a big jump -- from $434 billion in 2008 to $537 billion in 2010.

But that’s a 24 percent increase, not the 84 percent claimed by Ryan and his colleagues.

Is someone’s math fuzzy? Let’s dig in to find out.

Ryan’s calculations also include another number -- the discretionary spending portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the economic stimulus package. That adds another $259 million to the total, which brings it to $797 billion (with rounding) and the 84 percent.

One problem, and it’s a significant one in terms of Ryan’s statement:

The stimulus package was approved in February 2009.

Ryan includes it in the 2010 totals, so the two-year trend under Obama looks like a rocket headed straight up.

If you put it in 2009 -- when it was passed -- the two-year trend under Obama looks more like a roller-coaster ride: Up a lot, and then down some but not all the way.

Let’s turn to some budget watchdog groups to assess the approach.

First, not everyone agrees it’s appropriate to even include the stimulus money in the calculation, since it could be considered one-time emergency spending -- not part of the underlying base. The annual figures that are the basis of Ryan’s chart do not include emergency spending, such as for natural disasters or unforeseen war costs.

Obama and Democrats argue the stimulus package -- which tallied $862 billion in all --- was the ultimate ""emergency"" allocation aimed at preventing another Great Depression.

Most experts told PolitiFact Wisconsin it’s fine to include it, as long as it appears as a one-time blip -- creating that roller-coaster rise and fall.

""The discretionary spending in the stimulus bill has already begun to fade and no one assumes stimulus bill levels of spending will continue every year into the future,"" said Joshua Gordon, policy director at The Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that advocates for fiscal responsibility.

His group and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities agree the stimulus funding should be placed in 2009.

That’s when the vote occurred, when the spending authority for nearly all of it was granted, and that’s how the Congressional Budget Office records it. And Ryan’s own press release, in the fine print, refers to the stimulus funds as 2009 spending.

Putting them in 2010 may make a stronger rhetorical point, but a shaky mathematical one.

Why did Ryan do it that way?  

In response, Ryan’s office said in an e-mail he presents the budget figure on the chart with and without stimulus funding ""so readers can separate the two if they wish.""

But in his public statements about the increase, he doesn’t separate them at all. He uses the higher, skewed number.

Ryan’s office also says the cumulative view, not the year to year, is what’s important in the spending trend. They say if you just look at 2008 and 2010, it’s as if the stimulus never occurred.

But the stimulus money was a one time authorization. It is not part of the annual base, so following past Washington accounting practice it belongs in the year it was approved.

Finally, Ryan’s office argues his analysis does not include the vast majority of the stimulus spending. That’s certainly true. But it’s Ryan who limits the statement -- and the discussion of it -- to discretionary spending and when budget authority was granted.

Ryan aides said the congressman is not using the figures to make Obama look bad -- he blames the long-term increase in spending on both parties..

""He is making a policy argument that we should return to sustainable levels of government spending,"" said spokesman Conor Sweeney.

To be sure, no matter what year you stick it in, that $259 billion in discretionary stimulus funding -- and the massive overall package -- represents a dramatic spending leap.

But if you put it in 2009 -- where evidence says it belongs -- you get a different picture than the one presented by Ryan. If it is there, the change in discretionary spending under Obama was a 70 percent increase in the first year, followed by a 27 percent drop in the second.

That second year is still higher than the starting point, because non-stimulus spending also rose.

That brings us back to the 24 percent overall increase between 2008 and 2010, which is where we began.

And that’s where we will end.

In illustrating his point about spending increases under President Obama, Ryan says non-defense discretionary spending has risen 84 percent. There is no doubt that spending is up, or that the one-time stimulus package was a major driver. But sliding the stimulus money from 2009 to 2010 -- whether on a chart or in an interview -- skews the picture.

It’s a nifty accounting maneuver. But still a maneuver. We rate Ryan’s claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968AA080>],/factchecks/2010/nov/07/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-us-discretionary-spending-increased/

Gov. Rick Perry says the federal government regulates how much salt we can put on our food
","
Shortly after Texas voters decided Gov. Rick Perry was worth his salt by re-electing him, Perry launched a national tour this week to sling his new book. 
In the first chapter of ""Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington,"" which was first available at Perry's election-night party, Perry writes: ""We are fed up with being overtaxed and overregulated. We are tired of being told how much salt we can put on our food, what windows we can buy for our house, what kind of cars we can drive, what kinds of guns we can own, what kind of prayers we are allowed to and where we can say them, what political speech we are allowed to use to elect candidates, what kind of energy we can use, what kind of food we can grow, what doctor we can see and countless other restrictions on our right to live as we see fit."" 
We won't look at every regulation Perry sees out there for this article, but we wondered if he's right about government telling us how much to salt our food. 
Responding to our request for elaboration, Carolyn O'Keefe, a publicity manager for the book, sent us a link to an April 20 Washington Post news article that says the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ""is planning an unprecedented effort to gradually reduce the salt consumed each day by Americans, saying that less sodium in everything from soup to nuts would prevent thousands of deaths from hypertension and heart disease. The initiative, to be launched this year, would eventually lead to the first legal limits on the amount of salt allowed in food products."" 
The article continues: ""The government intends to work with the food industry and health experts to reduce sodium gradually over a period of years to adjust the American palate to a less salty diet, according to FDA sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the initiative had not been formally announced. Officials have not determined salt limits."" 
Should we shelve our shakers? 
Not so fast. The same day, the FDA issued a press release saying the Post story ""leaves a mistaken impression that the FDA has begun the process of regulating the amount of sodium in foods. The FDA is not currently working on regulations nor has it made a decision to regulate sodium content in foods at this time."" 
When we showed the press release to O'Keefe, she said she would pass it along to Perry ""to see if there are any comments."" 
Next, we sought information from the FDA, whose website says the agency requires nutrition labels to include how much sodium is in, for example, a can of Coca-Cola (45 milligrams per serving). 
A page about salt on the site that was last updated May 18 says that while the agency has the authority to limit the amount of salt added to processed foods, it hasn't. It is, however, ""conducting research in this area,"" according to the site. 
In 2005, the Center for Science in the Public Interest asked the FDA to impose limits on the amount of salt in processed foods, according to the FDA website. More recently, the FDA sponsored an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, ""Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake in the United States."" Among other suggestions, the April 20 report recommends that the FDA ""expeditiously initiate a process to set a mandatory national standards for the sodium content of foods."" 
""These recommendations are being carefully reviewed and evaluated by the FDA,"" according to the FDA site. 
Currently, salt is regulated by the FDA as a ""generally recognized as safe"" (GRAS) ingredient, which means the FDA doesn't approve it before people can use it. A GRAS ingredient is ""one that has a long history of safe, common use in foods, or that is determined to be safe, for the intended use, based on proven science,"" according to the FDA site. 
Pat El-Hinnawy, a spokeswoman with FDA, told us that the agency ""is not currently working on regulations nor has it made a decision to regulate sodium content in foods at this time."" 
How does Perry's statement shake out? 
An agency has been exploring ways to reduce sodium in the food supply and federal dietary guidelines recommend consuming less than 2,300 milligrams, or about 1 teaspoon, of sodium per day. But government isn't telling anyone how much salt to sprinkle. We rate Perry's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809695C800>],/factchecks/2010/nov/06/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-federal-government-regulates-h/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Children', 'Catherine Glenn Foster']","
Abortions done under legal exceptions are still abortions
","The story of a 10-year-old rape victim having to travel from Ohio to Indiana to get an abortion has gained international attention. President Joe Biden talked about the case while giving a speech on abortion rights.  ""Ten years old. Raped, six weeks pregnant. Already traumatized. Was forced to travel to another state,"" Biden said July 8. ""Imagine being that little girl. Just — I’m serious — just imagine being that little girl. Ten years old."" U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., made reference to this case during a House Judiciary Committee hearing about ""the threat to individual freedoms in a post-Roe world"" on July 14.  He asked witness Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group: ""Do you think a 10-year-old would choose to carry?"" ""If a 10-year-old became pregnant as a result of rape and it was threatening her life, then that’s not an abortion,"" Glenn Foster responded after some back-and-forth. We reached out to Americans United for Life for comment, but did not hear back.  We had never heard this argument before, so we looked into whether abortions administered because of exceptions in abortion law change the definition of an abortion. They don’t.  The definition of an abortion varies slightly depending on the medical source or expert consulted. In medical terms, abortion is broadly considered a procedure undertaken to end a pregnancy. The National Institutes of Health defines an abortion as a procedure ""to end a pregnancy.""  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists uses the term induced abortion, which ""ends a pregnancy with medication or a medical procedure."" In an email to PolitiFact, the organization made a distinction between this and a spontaneous abortion, ""the clinical terminology for miscarriage."" The Mayo Clinic provides a definition for a ""medical abortion"" as ""a procedure that uses medication to end a pregnancy."" It adds that a medical abortion can be used ""to complete an early miscarriage or end an unwanted pregnancy.""  Legal scholars tend to approach the matter differently than those in the medical community. When it comes to a legal definition, what constitutes an abortion is often dictated in part by whether the patient made a conscious decision to terminate the pregnancy.  According to the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School, an ""abortion is the intentional termination of a pregnancy."" Abortion laws across the states have used similar definitions.  In Ohio, the law defines an abortion as ""the purposeful termination of a human pregnancy by any person, including the pregnant woman herself, with an intention other than to produce a live birth or to remove a dead fetus or embryo. Abortion is the practice of medicine or surgery."" Even though there are differences in the medical and legal definitions of abortions, they all revolve around the ending of a pregnancy.  The reason for terminating does not change the fact that the ending of that pregnancy is an abortion. That goes for abortions that are performed as a result of common exceptions under abortion laws: rape, incest or the health or life of the mother. ""The definition of abortion is not dependent on the reason for needing an abortion,"" a spokesperson with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists told PolitiFact.  Laws restricting abortion have been coming into effect across the country after the June 24 Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Most of these laws include limited exceptions, meaning a patient can legally get an abortion for the life or health of the mother or a medical emergency. Only about one-third of the laws allow abortions in cases involving rape and incest.  Chart created by PolitiFact Senior Correspondent Louis Jacobson ""Regardless of those exceptions, terminating a pregnancy is an abortion,"" said Daniel Grossman, professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at University of California San Francisco. ""An abortion means terminating a pregnancy, regardless of the reasons for terminating that pregnancy."" Foster said, ""If a 10-year-old became pregnant as a result of rape and it was threatening her life, then that’s not an abortion."" An abortion is the termination of a pregnancy. Neither medical nor legal definitions say the classification of an abortion is contingent on whether or not a law includes an exception.  Cases of rape, incest or if the mother’s life or health is at risk are often included as exceptions in laws restricting abortion. But that does not change the classification of the procedure as an abortion.  We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809695CD80>],/factchecks/2022/jul/15/catherine-glenn-foster/abortions-done-under-legal-exceptions-are-still-ab/

No, Biden didn’t give the 'same exact speech' months apart
","Footage showing President Joe Biden’s supposed verbal blunders has repeatedly circulated on social media, especially in conservative circles.  But many of these videos were deceptively edited or taken out of context. Such is the case with a July 14 Instagram post that suggests the president delivered the same speech twice.  ""Two separate occasions, months apart, exact same speech,"" read the words that appear across an Instagram post that spliced together two of Biden’s speeches.  The post, which was viewed more than 900,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Although the speeches highlighted in the Instagram post bear some similarities, they’re not identical and weren’t delivered months apart. Both were about the Biden administration's efforts to improve the economy. The speech on the right was given Dec. 1, 2021; the speech on the left was delivered on Dec. 3, 2021. And the Instagram post omitted much of their differences.  For example, Biden coughed and stammered Dec. 3, when he spoke of the latest developments in gas prices. He also noted that while China may release additional oil from its reserves, it hadn’t yet agreed to do so — something he didn’t mention Dec. 1.  Further, each speech focused on distinct tenets of the U.S. economy, and Biden shifted to different subjects after discussing prices at the pump. On Dec. 1, Biden hailed the American Rescue Plan for delivering ""significant tax cuts for families raising kids,"" while holding a news conference on the supply chain. On Dec. 3, Biden told reporters he spoke with large retailers and grocery stores to ensure they’re ""well-stocked"" and able to meet consumer demand ahead of the year-end holiday season. His remarks were made during a news briefing on the November 2021 jobs report.  An Instagram post claimed Biden gave the ""same exact speech"" months apart. That’s wrong. The two speeches included in the Instagram post were delivered only days apart. Although a portion of each speech bore similarities, Biden’s remarks were different and geared toward distinct tenets of the U.S. economy.  The post also omitted where the two speeches began to differ. For example, after Biden spoke of gas prices on Dec. 1, 2021, he immediately praised the American Rescue Plan. On Dec. 3, 2021, Biden spoke of consumer demand during the year-end holidays.

Youngkin's claim that Virginia protects same-sex marriage is flawed
","Gov. Glenn Youngkin was elusive when recently asked if he would take action to guarantee same sex-marriage under Virginia law. ""In Virginia, we actually do protect same-sex marriage,"" Youngkin, a Republican, told a national television audience June 10 on ""Face the Nation."" ""That’s the law in Virginia and therefore, as governor of Virginia, we protect same-sex marriage."" A number of state Democrats later accused Youngkin of spreading — to put it nicely — malarkey.  ""The Governor either doesn’t know Virginia’s constitution or he’s lying & assuming we won’t notice,"" tweeted U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger. State Sen. Adam Ebbin of Alexandria told the Richmond Times-Dispatch, ""Either [Youngkin] is ignorant of the status of gay marriage in Virginia or chose to lie."" So, we fact checked Youngkin’s statement.   Same-sex marriage in Virginia and across the nation is guaranteed by the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.   But here’s what Youngkin didn’t mention on camera: The Obergefell decision, made on a 5-to-4 vote, supersedes a still-existing provision in Virginia’s constitution that prohibits same-sex marriage. Should the current conservative majority on the high court reverse Obergefell, same-sex marriage would instantly become illegal in Virginia. Virginia’s constitutional ban on same-sex marriage was approved by voters in 2006. The General Assembly passed a bill in 2021 to ask voters to repeal the amendment. But proposed amendments to Virginia’s constitution must be passed by the legislature two straight years before they’re placed on ballots and, earlier this year, a subcommittee in the Republican-led House killed the bill on a 6-to-4 vote. Youngkin’s press secretary, Macaulay Porter, noted that the General Assembly passed legislation that repealed a state law barring same-sex marriage. But state laws are subservient to Virginia’s constitution, which still has the ban. The constitutional amendment ""makes it clear that no other relationship may, by law, be given the status of a legal marriage,"" A.E. Dick Howard, a professor at the University of Virginia’s law school, wrote in an email. ""If Obergefell were to be overturned, then, in Virginia, the marriage amendment would take precedence over any conflicting provision of state law. Same-sex marriages would not be recognized in Virginia."" Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond’s law school, agreed. ""If the Supreme Court reversed itself, same-sex marriage would become illegal [in Virginia],"" he said. A key question is whether the Obergefell decision is in danger of being reversed, a matter Youngkin dismissed as ""hypothetical."" But many legal observers and members of the LGBTQ+ community see it as a real possibility following the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade in June, a 49-year-old precedent guaranteeing abortion rights. The court empowered states to set their own abortion laws. Justice Clarence Thomas deepened concerns in his concurring opinion, writing that the court should review its decisions in Obergefell and other ""demonstratively erroneous"" cases that have granted rights not specifically mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. Other justices in the majority did not echo Thomas’s sentiment and stressed that their ruling only applied to abortion.  Youngkin said, ""In Virginia, we actually do protect same-sex marriage. That’s the law in Virginia and therefore, as governor of Virginia, we protect same-sex marriage."" His statement is disingenuous. The only reason Virginia protects same-sex marriage is because a 2015 Supreme Court ruling requires all states to do so. Virginia law tacitly allows same-sex marriage. But it is superseded by the state constitution that specifically bans such unions, a provision that the Republican-led House stood by earlier this year. Should the high court reverse its 2015 ruling, as Thomas would like to see, same-sex marriage in Virginia would instantly end. Younkin told viewers of ""Face the Nation"" a small piece of the story. Although Virginia allows gay marriage, the state law he cites as protecting it is meaningless.  We rate Youngkin’s statement Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A42FB00>],/factchecks/2022/jul/15/glenn-youngkin/youngkins-claim-virginia-protects-same-sex-marriag/

Val Demings’ ad criticizes Rubio’s attendance record
","U.S. Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., said her opponent in Florida’s U.S. Senate race, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, has a shoddy attendance record.  ""For 27 years, I showed up every day to put dangerous criminals away, never knowing I’d come home to my family, and when I was chief, we reduced violent crime by 40%,"" Demings said in a July 13 ad. ""But Marco, you’ve got one of the worst attendance records in the Senate. When Florida needs you, you just don’t show up."" Attacks for missed votes are common. But Rubio’s attendance record has come under repeated scrutiny from his political opponents.  In 2016, former President Donald Trump said Rubio had the ""No. 1 absentee record"" in the Senate, and we rated the claim Mostly True.  But does that criticism still hold up? We decided to find out.  Since taking office in 2011, Rubio has missed 346, or 9.2%, of 3,744 roll call votes, according to GovTrack, ​​a nonpartisan website that collects congressional data. On average, members of the Senate miss around 2.3% of votes during their tenure. Most of Rubio’s career absences occurred during his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. From April 2015 through March 2016, Rubio missed 129 votes.  That’s not unusual for a presidential candidate. For example, former President Barack Obama missed 314, or about 24%, of 1,300 roll call votes in his three-year Senate career. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who both vied for the White House, have worse attendance than Rubio.  Sanders has missed more than 14% of votes since 2007; Cruz missed 9.4% since he joined the Senate in 2013.  Still, Rubio’s attendance record did not immediately improve after his presidential campaign. According to ProPublica, in the 115th Congress, which ran from January 2017 to 2018, Rubio was the eighth most absent member in the Senate, out of 99 senators. (There was one vacancy.) In 2020, Rubio ranked 12th most absent among senators who have served more than 10 years. When looking at the current 117th Congress, however, Rubio’s attendance has improved. The 117th Congress began in 2021 and goes through January 2023. So far, he’s missed 41 votes, making him the 27th most absent member of the Senate. He cited ""travel difficulties"" for three absences, per ProPublica.  It’s also worth noting that none of the votes Rubio missed in the 117th Congress had a specific impact on Florida.  The most absent member of the Senate recently is Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota. So far, Rounds missed more than 25% of votes. Rubio’s campaign did not answer specific questions about his record. Instead, a spokesperson pointed to a list of his achievements in the Senate, including co-authoring the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP.  Demings said Rubio has ""one of the worst attendance records in the Senate. "" Looking at the percentage of roll call votes Rubio missed throughout his decade as a senator, the statement is accurate. Overall, Rubio missed more than 9% of votes since 2011 — well above the average of 2.3% among members of the Senate. One of the reasons for this is his unsuccessful run for the presidency in 2016. Rubio’s attendance record in the 117th Congress is a bit better. So far, he has missed 41 votes, making him the 27th most absent member of the Senate. We rate Demings' claim Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F9F80>],/factchecks/2022/jul/14/val-demings/val-demings-ad-criticizes-rubios-attendance-record/

Pregnant women in Kenya have the right to vote
","Kenyan citizens are calling for the record to be set straight after a Fox News host’s comments about voting rights in the country went viral.  On a July 5 episode of ""Gutfeld!"" Fox News host Emily Compagno called out singer Katy Perry for tweeting on the Fourth of July that women in America had fewer rights than a firecracker. Compagno disagreed, and used Kenya as an example to back up her argument.  ""She’s talking about what, voting rights? That we have less voting rights here? What about in Kenya, where pregnant women can’t leave the house, so they absolutely have no constructive right to vote?,"" Compagno said.  It’s unclear whether Perry’s tweet was specifically about voting rights for women. But Compagno’s response to it received plenty of social media pushback from Kenyans and Kenyan government officials, who pointed out that pregnant women in the country do indeed have voting rights.  Charity Ngilu, county governor in Kitui and Kenya’s first female presidential candidate, tweeted in dissent of the claim. Female members of the Parliament of Kenya, referred to as Women Representatives, also shot back.  ""Pregnant women in Kenya are allowed to leave the house. Pregnant women in Kenya can vote. Pregnant women get priority on voting lines,"" wrote Women Representative Esther Passaris. In 2017, Agence France Presse reported that a pregnant woman went into labor and gave birth while waiting in line to vote at a polling station in Kenya. After going to a local health clinic, she returned to her polling place and cast her ballot. Rehema Dida Jaldesa, a fellow Women Representative from Isiolo County, Kenya, told PolitiFact,""That statement is entirely false as pregnant women, people with disabilities and the elderly hold the right to vote. In addition, it is common for them to be moved to the front of the polling queue, and given priority to vote. It is unfortunate that Emily Compagno and Fox News are spreading misinformation when they have the internet to fact-check."" The rules that Jaldesa referred to are in protocols written in October 2020 by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, a regulatory agency responsible for conducting elections in the country. On page 11, the commission wrote that ""persons with proven pre-existing medical conditions as well as elderly people, the disabled, lactating mothers, pregnant mothers and the sick will be given priority"" in voting lines.  Kenyan law stipulates that every adult has the right to vote. The commission lists that a person can be denied registration to vote if they:  Are younger than 18 years old Do not have a valid ID or Kenyan passport Have an undischarged bankruptcy Are convicted as guilty of an electoral offense Have been found by a court to not be of sound mind.  We reached out to Fox News to ask whether Compagno could corroborate her claim, but received no response. However, The Daily Beast reported that Compago doubled down on her statement and cited an article from Grazia Daily and a report from the World Population Review. Grazia Daily did not include a source to back up its claim, and the World Population Review, citing a 2019 United Nations report about election-related sexualized violence against women, acknowledged that pregnant women in Kenya can vote and are given priority in lines. 
  A Fox News host claimed that in Kenya, pregnant women could not leave the house and therefore could not vote.  Both Kenyan citizens and government officials pointed to evidence to the contrary. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission issued regulations to allow pregnant women to be given priority in voting lines, and Kenyan law stipulates that all adults are able to vote.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809789ADC0>],/factchecks/2022/jul/14/emily-compagno/pregnant-women-kenya-have-right-vote/

Trump back on hot seat with claim linking ballot box ruling to 2020 election
","Former President Donald Trump, who fell nearly 21,000 votes short of winning Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election, has never accepted defeat in the Badger State. Not after his own recount request in Milwaukee and Dane counties actually increased Joe Biden’s margin of victory. Not after a series of lawsuits failed. Not after the election result was certified. Not after electoral votes were counted, after Biden was sworn in, or in the face of expert after expert saying there is no evidence of widespread fraud, and no way to undo the result. So, maybe it’s no surprise that Trump now apparently wants to go back in time. On July 8, 2022, the state Supreme Court ruled that Wisconsin law does not permit drop boxes anywhere other than election clerk offices and that only state lawmakers may make new policy stating otherwise — not the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which had issued guidance to clerks allowing them. Following the decision, Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, and Telegram to declare: ""Other States are looking at, and studying, the amazing Wisconsin Supreme Court decision declaring Ballot Boxes ILLEGAL, and that decision includes the 2020 Presidential Election."" In other words, he is claiming the decision is retroactive, and — in his view — could somehow cancel the result. That’s plainly nonsense. Ruling doesn’t look backward Let’s start with some basic facts. Drop boxes allow absentee ballots to be returned to the boxes, often placed at locations such as libraries or even police stations, instead of being dropped in the mail and returned to clerk’s offices.  Drop boxes are used across the state — not just in typically Democratic urban areas. According to an affidavit from Meagan Wolfe, Wisconsin Elections Commission administrator, ""At the time of the 2020 General Election, the Commission was aware of 528 drop boxes across the state of Wisconsin…By Spring 2021, local officials had reported 570 drop boxes to the Commission, spanning at least 66 of Wisconsin’s 72 counties.""    Republicans on the Wisconsin Election Commission signed on to the guidance to clerks for 2020 that clarified drop box use. The use of drop boxes was not part of Trump’s legal challenges in the immediate wake of the 2020 election. And drop boxes were in use in 2016, when Trump won a narrow victory in Wisconsin.  Indeed, an Oct. 16, 2020, article in the run-up to the election from PolitiFact National  noted that ballot drop boxes have been in use for about two decades.  Importantly, the new Wisconsin Supreme Court decision does not indicate, or even suggest, that there is any retroactive aspect to the decision. To be clear, this past January, while the case was under consideration, the court explicitly left drop boxes in place for the Feb. 15, 2022, primary for Milwaukee mayor and local offices across the state.   What’s more, there is no evidence that Biden supporters were more likely than Trump supporters to use the drop boxes. There was a huge influx in absentee ballots across the state in 2020 because of concerns about voting during the pandemic. ""The Supreme Court ruling does not apply to the 2020 presidential election,"" Barry C. Burden, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and director of the Elections Research Center, told us. ""That election has been audited, recounted, and certified. The electoral votes from Wisconsin were counted in Washington on January 6. None of that can be undone. ""There were multiple lawsuits filed after the election by Trump and his allies in hopes that various categories of absentee ballots — including those returned by drop box or other individuals — would not be counted. All of those lawsuits failed. ""The Supreme Court's decision applies to elections going forward."" In a July 13, 2022, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article, Rick Esenberg, president and chief counsel of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, which filed the lawsuit challenging the boxes, said interpretations of the ruling as having a retroactive effect are incorrect. ""The case was prospective only,"" Esenberg said. ""It declared that drop boxes are not permitted under Wisconsin law. Now, if some municipality would go ahead and use boxes anyway in a manner that’s not permitted by the court, then somebody would be able to challenge that and they might be able to get those ballots drawn down. But there's no retroactive impact."" Trump’s record on Wisconsin-related claims has been, well, checkered at best: Sept. 29, 2020, Trump claimed ballots in Wisconsin ""are being dumped in rivers"" or creeks. We rated this claim False. Nov. 18, 2020, Trump claimed ""A day AFTER the election, Biden receives a dump of 143,379 votes at 3:42AM (in Wisconsin), when they learned he was losing badly. This is unbelievable!"" We rated this claim Pants on Fire.  Dec. 2, 2020, Trump claimed ""In Wisconsin, there are approximately 70,000 absentee ballots that do not have matching ballot applications as required by law."" We rated this claim Pants on Fire. Dec. 2, 2020, Trump claimed in a speech that residents the Wisconsin Election Commission suspected of moving were ""illegal voters."" We rated that claim False. June 25, 2021, Trump claimed Republican leaders ""are working hard to cover up election corruption in Wisconsin."" We rated this claim Pants on Fire.  June 26, 2021, Trump claimed ""In 2020 we won (Wisconsin)."" We rated this claim Pants on Fire.  August 12, 2021, Trump claimed: ""A Milwaukee election employee even acknowledged dropping off just the margin of ballots needed for a Biden win at 3 a.m."" We rated this claim Pants on Fire.  Our ruling Trump claimed the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision declaring ballot drop boxes illegal ""includes the 2020 Presidential Election."" That claim defies logic, and the court’s order itself. The state Supreme Court itself has explicitly permitted the drop boxes in some past elections. And its order is prospective — for the future, not the past. And that’s an assessment from the group that filed the lawsuit. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

Greg Abbott is right that Texas' high school graduation rate is 90%
","Gov. Greg Abbott's re-election campaign lauded education in Texas, with a May 15 video touting Blue Ribbon public schools, U.S. News ranking four Texas high schools among the top 50 STEM high schools, and the Texas public high school graduation rate. ""Governor @GregAbbott_TX has lead education to a brighter future,"" Abbott's campaign Twitter account @TexansforAbbott's tweeted, ""That's why Texas' public high school graduation rate is at 90% overall."" Does Texas have a 90% high school graduation rate? State data supports the Abbott campaign's statistic. PolitiFact Texas reached out to Abbott's campaign but did not hear back. However, the video credited the Texas Education Agency for the graduation rate statistic. Of the students who started ninth grade in 2016-17, scheduled to graduate in 2020, 90.3% graduated within four years, according to a 2019-20 report by the agency. This percentage is called the four-year longitudinal graduation rate, because it measures how much of a starting ninth grade class completes high school within four years. The remaining 10% might have continued school, received a high school equivalency certificate, or dropped out. Abbott's statistic checks out. Some demographic groups have better graduation rates than others. Economically disadvantaged students graduated 6 percentage points lower (87.5%) than those who were not (93.5%). Compared with state averages, there were lower graduation rates and higher dropout rates for students in special education programs and students identified as learning English as a second language. Abbott and his predecessor Rick Perry have long rallied around their work on education and touted Texas' high school graduation rate. In 2018, Abbott said Texas ranked among the nation's top five states for its high school graduation rate. PolitiFact Texas found that to be True. In 2015 and 2013, PolitiFact rated statements by Perry to be Mostly True that Texas' high school graduation rates were third-highest in the nation. In 2011, Texas tied with five states for that title of No. 3. Texas was ahead of the national average graduation rate at 86% in 2018-19, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. It was among eight states with a 90% or higher graduation rate. In the mid-2000s, Texas took an aggressive approach to turning around high schools that were not graduating at least 60% of its senior class, said Jacob Kirksey, assistant professor of educational psychology, leadership and counseling at Texas Tech University. Many states including Texas saw gains around this time because of the No Child Left Behind Act. High schools later also adopted career- and college-readiness models. The state education system under Abbott continued this effort that began during Perry's leadership. ""Compared to other states, I think Texas is not afraid to make changes and to try things out, which I think is a really important and powerful perspective to have in policy,"" Kirksey said. ""At the end of the day, Texas is improving on all metrics with respect to graduation rates and attrition rates."" Gov. Greg Abbott's campaign tweeted, ""Texas' public high school graduation rate is at 90% overall,"" accompanying a video touting K-12 and higher education wins.

Adults older than 51 won’t get free money to help stave off inflation

The post’s promise of a free spending card is similar to a claim PolitiFact previously ruled  Mostly False. However, that claim was targeting adults 65 and older with the promise of a Medicare flex card. Flex cards exist but aren’t issued by Medicare, the federally-run insurance program for older adults and people with certain disabilities. The flex cards also have limitations. The prepaid debit cards are offered to eligible customers who purchase Medicare Advantage, a Medicare-approved plan through a private insurance company. Flex Cards are not available in every state, and not all private insurance companies offer them to customers. The cards can be used only to cover certain qualifying medical expenses, such as medications, copays and medical equipment. Some insurance companies do provide a grocery stipend for Medicare Advantage customers, but it's typically restricted to ""healthy foods"" such as fresh fruits, vegetables and salad kits. These plans are available only to people who qualify for Medicare — which would disqualify anyone 51 to 64 years old and contradict the Facebook post. A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the agency administering Medicare, previously told PolitiFact that claims such as those made in the Facebook post are typically scams trying to steal Medicare recipients' information to make fraudulent charges in their names.  A Facebook post claims adults 51 and older are eligible for a Medicare spending card to help pay for rising expenses because of inflation.

Joe Biden’s dubious math on the federal income tax burden
","During a recent speech on the economy in Cleveland, President Joe Biden sought to spotlight the difference in tax burdens between the richest Americans and more typical taxpayers. ""Billionaires in America — there’s 789 or thereabouts. You know what average federal income tax they pay? 8%,"" Biden said July 6. ""Every one of you have a job (in which you pay) more than 8% (in taxes) — every single one of you. If you’re a cop, a teacher, a firefighter, union worker, you probably pay two to three times that."" However, tax specialists say that Biden’s comparison is faulty. First, the 8% figure is a lowball estimate that uses a hypothetical calculation. And second, Biden’s statement ignores that most of the middle-income households he’s referring to pay tax rates of between zero and 15%. ""The claim is dishonest and deceptive,"" said Alex Muresianu, a federal policy analyst at the Tax Foundation. The first part of Biden’s statement is misleading. The White House told PolitiFact that the figure comes from a White House report that looked at what would happen if the United States were to tax unrealized gains on stocks. Currently, if someone sees their stock shares rise in value over time, those gains are not taxed unless and until the shares are sold. If the shares are never sold, then they are never taxed, and under current law — which Biden has proposed changing — they may be passed on to the next generation with little or no taxation. (Despite the similar sounding name, unrealized gains are different from capital gains taxes; capital gains taxes are levied when the stock is sold.)  The White House report found that if you include unrealized gains in the income calculations of the 400 richest U.S. families, then their taxes paid would account for just 8.2% of their income. Economists and policymakers have long debated whether the government should tax unrealized gains. But Biden made it sound like 8% was the standard rate today, not what would happen under a future proposal.  What is the actual tax burden under the current tax code for the wealthiest Americans? IRS data from 2019 shows that the top 1% of taxpayers paid an average federal income tax rate of 25.6%, or about three times more than the White House’s estimate. A more elite group, the top 0.001% — which in 2019 meant people earning about $60 million or more — paid a percentage that was only modestly smaller, 22.9%. ""Using the existing definition of taxable income, really rich people pay an average federal income tax rate in the mid-20s,"" said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. ""If you want to include unrealized gains in your denominator, as the White House does, the average rate would go way down."" Biden is offbase on middle-class tax rates, too. For starters, Biden’s statement ignores that 43.6% of households paid zero or negative net federal individual income taxes in 2019, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. (The percentage was higher in 2020, but that was because of temporary tax relief provisions during the coronavirus pandemic, so tax experts said it’s best to use the prepandemic figure from 2019.) That’s a lot of Americans paying zero federal income taxes. They may have paid payroll or other federal taxes, and potentially state or local taxes, but Biden specifically cited the ""federal income tax"" in his remarks. For a sense of scale, the bottom 40% of American incomes in 2018 included those earning below about $43,000 a year.  The specific professions Biden cited earn a bit more than $43,000. The median annual income without overtime for police officers is $64,605; it’s $50,939 for firefighters and $67,080 for K-12 teachers. Still, measured by actual taxes paid under current law, the effective tax rate for incomes in this range are not two or three times higher than what the wealthiest pay.  For households with adjusted gross incomes between $50,000 and $100,000, the Tax Policy Center found, a plurality of 42% paid an effective tax rate between 5% and 10%, while another 30% paid an effective rate between 10% and 15%. Also, 15% of those households paid an effective overall rate below 5%, and another 5% paid nothing at all or got money back from the government. In addition, while ordinary Americans have smaller stock holdings than the richest families do, many middle-income Americans have retirement accounts with plenty of unrealized income. Biden’s comparison takes unrealized income into account for the richest Americans, but not for ordinary Americans. Biden said the ""average federal income tax"" paid by the richest Americans is ""8%. … If you’re a cop, a teacher, a firefighter, union worker, you probably pay two to three times that."" Today, the richest Americans pay an effective tax rate of more than 20% of their income as counted under the current tax code, not 8%.  Meanwhile, among households earning between $50,000 and $100,000 a year, the vast majority paid effective tax rates of between 0 and 15%, which is not two to three times the rate that the richest pay. Biden’s statement is not accurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BA5440>],/factchecks/2022/jul/13/joe-biden/joe-bidens-dubious-math-federal-income-tax-burden/

ADHD was not invented to disadvantage Black children and increase pharmaceutical sales
","A video clip circulating on Facebook claims attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was fabricated to disadvantage Black boys.  ""ADHD does not exist. Neither does the learning disability,"" said Umar Johnson, a sociopolitical activist, in the video, which was filmed in 2017. A 14-second clip from Johnson's interview was shared on Reels and sums up the discussion with this claim: ""ADHD does not exist."" The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  But the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders says attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder does exist. The DSM is the American Psychiatric Association handbook medical professionals rely on for mental diagnoses.  People diagnosed with ADHD ""show a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity — impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Johnson’s broader argument asserts that  ADHD is overdiagnosed in Black boys so that large pharmaceutical companies can profit from the sale of ADHD drugs. Johnson has a doctorate in clinical psychology, is a certified school psychologist and wrote a book on ADHD and special education.  ""Simply diagnosing a Black boy with ADD did not result in a prescription. The drug companies were losing money. Wall Street was not getting paid, so they forced the American Psychiatric Association to add the H — attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"" Johnson said in the video. That's not true, said Dr. Eugene Arnold, a psychiatry and behavioral health professor at Ohio State University who studies drug development and alternative treatments for ADHD.  Benjamin Lahey, professor of public health sciences at the University of Chicago who researches ADHD, agreed with Arnold. ""There's nothing about the diagnostic criteria that rules out medication,"" Lahey said. Lahey was part of the child disorders workgroup for the fourth DSM, which was published in 1994 and defined ADHD and its list of symptoms. Lahey considers himself ""the person most involved"" because he ran the fourth DSM’s field trials. ""It was all about the data on symptoms and impairment to the children's lives, never about coming up with some kind of bogus disorder that would sell more medications,"" Lahey said. Johnson did not respond to email requests for comment. Johnson's now-circulating ADHD claims originate from a 2017 interview with Houston radio station KQBT-FM 93.7, aka The Beat, in which he asked Black parents to refrain from getting their children evaluated for ADHD.  Skepticism about the validity of inattention as a disorder has been around for generations.  Let's break Johnson’s claims into four parts: the history of ADHD, Big Pharma's influence on the ADHD criteria, racial disparities in diagnoses and why the disorder is still controversial. The earliest documentation of an inattention disorder similar to modern-day ADHD traces back to 1798, when a Scottish physician, Alexander Crichton, published ""An Inquiry Into the Nature and Origin of Mental Derangement,"" one of the first English textbooks on psychiatry. Crichton characterized ""the incapacity of attending with a necessary degree of constancy to any one object"" as a mental disease that can be identified in childhood.  It wasn't until 1902 that the ""scientific starting point of the history of ADHD"" came along, according to a study published in the National Library of Medicine. A British pediatrician described a ""lack of moral control"" using some similar patterns seen in people with ADHD, including a desire for instant gratification and impulsivity. In 1932, two German physicians reported on children with increased motor restlessness and an inability to stay still. They called it a hyperkinetic disease of infancy, and it was the first recorded instance of what’s now called ADHD. The characteristics defining this hyperkinetic disease — inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity — are the same as ADHD’s  three main symptoms. In 1937, U.S. physician Charles Bradley reported on the first positive effect of stimulant medication in children. Bradley wasn't looking to resolve children’s troubles with focus, but to find a drug to help them with emotional distress, journalist Alan Schwarz wrote in his 2016 book, ""ADHD Nation: Children, Doctors, Big Pharma, and the Making of an American Epidemic.""  Bradley tested the drug Benzedrine on 30 children and noted ""the remarkably improved school performance of approximately half,"" in his 1937 study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry. During the 1930s, ’40s and ’50s, research on mental illnesses or behavioral disorders in children was often categorized as ""minimal brain dysfunction."" It was theorized that children who displayed behavioral abnormalities may have had minimal brain damage, although this characterization was later criticized as too speculative. The term ""hyperkinetic impulse disorder"" was coined in 1957, because research was showing ""you couldn't always demonstrate damage,"" said Arnold, the psychiatry researcher from Ohio State University. To treat the new, ambiguous hyperkinetic impulse disorder, U.S. physicians Charles Bradley and Leon Eisenberg conducted a 1963 study on how ""disturbed children"" reacted to Ritalin. They found the drug did ease their symptoms. U.S. use of Ritalin increased after the American Psychiatric Association validated its hyperkinetic dysfunction definition. Drug companies started marketing Ritalin to parents as a way to get children to behave. In 1970, The Washington Post published an article reporting that 5% to 10% of children in a Nebraska elementary school system were taking drugs to control their hyperactivity as part of a ""behavior modification program."" Following  a movement led by Dr. Virginia Douglas, the APA renamed the disorder  ""attention deficit disorder (ADD) (with or without hyperactivity)"" in the third DSM handbook, published in 1980. In 1987, the APA published a revised edition that eliminated the two subtypes and renamed ADD as ""attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  ""That was just a mistake,"" Lahey said of eliminating the subtypes. ""It was a very different group of people who had access to much less data. It was not a data-based decision that was, I think, sensible for them to make."" Backed by Lahey's field research, the fourth DSM handbook, published in 1994, reinstated the subtypes and introduced three categorizations: ""a predominantly inattentive type, a predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, and a combined type with symptoms of both dimensions."" Lahey said that's why there's now a slash in the name: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, ""which means you can have either high levels of attention or high levels of hyperactivity, or both."" The most recent handbook for mental disorders recognizes ADHD in both hyperactive people and inattentive people. People who show hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms often talk excessively, fidget and exhibit restlessness, the handbook states. People who show inattention symptoms often lose things, have poor organizational skills, are forgetful and make careless mistakes. ADHD is not a one-size-fits-all diagnosis. People who exhibit high levels of ADHD behavior are more likely to have serious, even fatal, accidental injuries. They are also more likely to develop depression and become suicidal compared with other children, Lahey said.  ""There's a range of how well kids pay attention and inhibit their impulses and regulate their motor behavior,"" Lahey said, ""and the ones that are most unregulated are going to have problems because of it."" It's true that ADHD medication, such as Adderall or Ritalin, are made by pharmaceutical companies that profit from drug sales.  Industry researcher IBIS World estimates that the U.S. ADHD medication manufacturing industry is worth $9.7 billion in 2022. With ADHD diagnoses surveyed to be rising, demand is high.  The Food and Drug Administration recently reported an ADHD-medication shortage. The APA has been criticized for its relationship with the pharmaceutical industry. Of the 170 researchers who worked on the fourth DSM published in 1994, 95 of them had a financial relationship with a drug maker from 1989 to 2004, a 2006 study found.  The APA's guidelines allow psychiatrists to take money from pharmaceutical companies, and the 2010 Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires hospitals and individual physicians to disclose any financial relationship with the industry. And those relationships still exist. The biopharmaceutical company that makes Adderall, Shire LLC, spent more than $42 million in research payments to hospitals and individuals, according to a federal government database.    But the idea that the APA bent to pharmaceutical company influence when creating the diagnostics for ADHD is nonsense, Lahey said. ""I can tell you — that from all the hundreds of hours I spent with people, other psychologists and psychiatrists who were involved in developing the criteria — that there was never a hint of creating or having an interest in creating a diagnostic category that was not valid in order to sell more medication,"" Lahey said. ""It was all about the data."" We were unable to find any evidence concretely showing that drug companies pressured the APA's criteria despite financial involvement.  Johnson claims there is a ""deliberate misdiagnosing of Black boys"" for ADHD. But multiple studies show that Black children have not been disproportionately diagnosed for ADHD compared with white children. In 2016, the CDC estimated that 6.1 million U.S. children — 9.4% of all U.S. children — have been diagnosed with ADHD. Of those diagnosed children, 62% were taking medication for ADHD, a CDC survey showed. But Black children in the U.S. were 70% less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD compared with white children, according to a 2014 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health study. Black children have higher risks for ADHD than others, according to a 2021 Brown University study, while a 2013 National Library of Medicine study found that white children are more likely to get diagnosed with ADHD compared with their peers of other races. ""The literature points to the fact that there's a whole access issue, and being able to get in to have a proper ADHD evaluation is lower in Black and Latino or Hispanic families,"" said Jeni Johnstone, assistant professor of psychiatry at Oregon Health and Science University's Center for ADHD Research. Johnstone, who researches racial differences in diagnoses and treatment, attributed the diagnosis decline to cultural differences, varying parenting styles, costs, waitlists and language barriers. The three experts PolitiFact spoke with — Johnstone, Lahey and Arnold — said there was no evidence pointing to a deliberate misdiagnosis of ADHD in Black male children. We found no other specific evidence proving this in our own review of studies about ADHD.  Increasing evidence suggests ADHD is being overdiagnosed, regardless of race. Johnson says this is because the pharmaceutical companies are pushing their drugs on the APA, but Lahey said it’s because physicians aren't trained on how to properly diagnose ADHD. ""They're trained to be physicians, and they're very good at diagnosing strep throat versus COVID,"" Lahey said, ""But they're not trained to be psychiatrists."" Many ADHD symptoms overlap with other mental illnesses. For example, children who are having trouble focusing in school may be diagnosed with ADHD when they are actually showing signs of post-traumatic stress or anxiety, Johnstone said. Besides a lack of proper training, Lahey said some medical professionals will shortcut the ""rigorous methods that we used in the DSM for field trials"" because it's time-consuming and costly, which could lead to over- or underdiagnoses.   ""There's just a lot of messiness in the application of the DSM criteria,"" Lahey said. ""But does ADHD exist? Yes. That pattern of behavior causes real problems for kids, and it should not be ignored."" The claim that ""ADHD does not exist"" is not accurate. Johnson’s underlying argument about the justification for medication and disproportionate diagnoses of ADHD in Black children do not give his takeaway more credibility, either. Research shows and psychiatrists told PolitiFact that ADHD is a real mental disorder with a recorded history that dates back to 1798. While misdiagnoses do occur, research shows that Black children are often underdiagnosed compared to white children with similar behavior patterns. We rate Johnson's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968A9700>],/factchecks/2022/jul/13/facebook-posts/adhd-was-not-invented-disadvantage-black-children/

There’s more than 400 years’ worth of evidence that slave ships and the slave trade itself, existed.  Remains of the Clotilda, the last known ship that transported kidnapped slaves from Benin, West Africa, to the United States, were found in Alabama’s Mobile River in May 2019.  The Alabama Historical Commission led the research to verify that the ship was indeed the Clotilda, which illegally transported 110 people to the state in 1860 — 50 years after the U.S. banned the importation of slaves. The emancipation of Black people in the United States was not recognized until 1865.  ""Co-conspirators, Timothy Meaher and Captain William Foster made an effort to evade authorities and destroy evidence of their criminal voyage by sinking, burning, and abandoning the vessel and then dividing the kidnapped Africans among their captors, where they remained in slavery until the end of the Civil War,"" the Alabama Historical Commission wrote on its website. To keep the pieces of the ship intact, the Clotilda remains at the river’s bottom. NPR reported that commission researchers are working to determine whether it’s possible to raise the vessel without destroying it. In the meantime, the commission has published images and gathered pieces from the wreckage to prove its location and existence.    PolitiFact contacted the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture to respond to the claim.

National Geographic provided an intricate look at the project’s work to dive for and research historical maritime sites of wreckage.   In total, 12.5 million enslaved people were brought to the United States.  Social media users questioned the existence of slave ships and the transatlantic slave trade.
