McCollum cites top estimate for Medicaid expansion
","The day after Congress passed major health care reform, Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum said he would challenge the law's constitutionality in court, in part because of its expansion of Medicaid, a government-run health insurance program for the poor. The new law ""manipulates the states into doing things that the states simply can't afford,"" McCollum said. He said that the new law would cost Florida at least $1.6 billion a year, and likely more. But it appears those numbers are based on reports that don't reflect the final version of the health care reform law. His numbers were first questioned by a news report from the Web site Health News Florida. ""The AHCA folks, the Agency for Health Care Administration in Tallahassee, that pays out Medicaid, estimates that it will be at least $1.6 billion more a year in costs to the sate of Florida, just for what they do,"" McCollum said. We wanted to look into McCollum's numbers, and how the Medicaid expansion works.Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government-run health care program for the very poor. (Its cousin, Medicare, is for senior citizens of any income level.) To get into Medicaid, you have to be not only poor, but also disabled, elderly, pregnant or a child. The new law changes that, opening up Medicaid to all of the poor, setting the limit at people who make less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Currently, that means a single person who makes $14,404 or less, and a family of four that has income of less than $29,327.Medicaid is actually a voluntary program, so states do not have to participate. But all states do, because the federal government puts up much of the money for the program. In Florida, the federal government was scheduled to pick up 55 percent of the the tab for Medicaid this year. But thanks to the stimulus, the federal government picked up even more, paying for 68 percent of the program for this year and next.But even though the federal government is paying for the majority of the program, it still represents significant spending for the state of Florida. Medicaid here serves about 2.8 million people at a cost to the state of $19 billion. That's about 28 percent of the state's entire budget going to health care for the very poor -- a group that doesn't employ lobbyists or make many campaign contributions.McCollum is correct that the new law will cost the state money, but much of that cost will be shouldered by the federal government. The federal government plans to pick up 100 percent of the tab for the expansion of Medicaid for the first few years, but after that, the percentage declines. McCollum said during his press conference announcing the lawsuit that the $1.6 billion was based on modeling developed by Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration. But the agency based that analysis on older versions of the legislation that weren't as generous to the states as the version that actually became law. The agency released a new analysis that is based on the actual bill President Barack Obama signed on Tuesday. The newer report calculated that Florida's share of increased costs would range between $149 million in 2014 and $1.1 billion in 2019, significantly less than what McCollum said. In 2019, by the way, about 1.5 million people previously uninsured would be covered, according to the report.But it's still possible that Florida's contribution will be less than that. Congress is currently working on a reconciliation bill to modify the law Obama signed on; House Democrats demanded the bill with a number of changes as a condition for passing the bill Obama signed. We can't say for sure that the reconciliation bill will become law, but if it does, it could decrease states' Medicaid contributions even more because the federal government would pick up even more of the tab for the Medicaid expansion.Here's a chart that shows the difference in those potential contributions: Federal contribution, current law Federal contribution, with reconciliation 2014 100 percent 100 percent 2015 100 percent 100 percent 2016 100 percent 100 percent 2017 92 percent 95 percent 2018 91 percent 94 percent 2019 90 percent 93 percent   AHCA said that the plan's cost of $1.1 billion could potentially grow to $1.6 billion in 2019. Spokesperson Tiffany Vause said the agency was working on a new estimate that would include another $300 million to pay for a required increase in payments to primary care physicians who see Medicaid patients, and another $100 million to $200 million for unspecified administrative costs that ""will incur to implement and manage all aspects of the new regulations."" The attorney general's office said they agreed with AHCA's conclusion. McCollum is also a Republican candidate for governor; his campaign staff referred the request to the attorney general's office because they said it was a matter of official state business Getting back to our ruling, McCollum said that it would cost Florida $1.6 billion or more to expand Medicaid. He is correct that Florida will have to pay more money into Medicaid to insure more of the poor. But the feds pick up most of the tab for the expansion in the early years, at a much lower cost than $1.6 billion. It only hits close to that top figure in 2019, and still have questions about the unspecified implementation costs. We find his claim Half True. Update: This report has been updated to include comment from the attorney general's office received after our original publication.",/factchecks/2010/mar/23/bill-mccollum/mccollum-cites-top-estimate-medicaid-expansion/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Health Care', 'Bart Stupak']","
Stupak revises abortion stance on health care bill, citing Obama's executive order
","With the health care bill teetering in the balance, antiabortion Democrat Rep. Bart Stupak's announcement hours before the final vote that an agreement had been reached on the abortion issue marked a momentous shift. For weeks, Stupak insisted he and a group of other abortion foes in the House could not support the Senate bill because it would result in federal funding of abortions, contrary to longstanding federal policy. But on the afternoon of March 21, 2010, Stupak said in a news conference that the promise of an executive order on abortion from President Barack Obama convinced him ""there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation."" Stupak's comments several hours later on the House floor provided some of the most emotionally charged moments of the late-night health care debate. ""It is the Democrats who, through the president's executive order, ensure that the sanctity of life is protected,"" Stupak said. His comments were interrupted by catcalls from the bill's Republican opponents, one of whom was heard to yell ""baby killer!"" Texas Republican Rep. Randy Neugebauer later said he was the one who shouted. But he said he yelled ""It's a baby killer,"" referring not to Stupak (to whom he apologized), but to the agreement Stupak helped forge with the president. The abortion issue in the health care reform debate has been thorny from the start. From early on, legislators on both sides of the abortion issue professed a desire to maintain the status quo on abortion in the health care bill. But that quickly proved difficult, if not impossible. Here's why: Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military. But the health care reform bill proposes a health care exchange in which private insurance companies could compete for the business of people who do not get their insurance through an employer. The question then: Should private companies be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do)? And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance? In the House, Stupak helped add an amendment that bars anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. The amendment does let them choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without using federal subsidies. And those who accept subsidies can still buy an abortion ""rider"" -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money. The Senate took a different tack. The Senate language on abortion, written by an abortion opponent, Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., would allow companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But Nelson inserted measures to ensure abortion services would be paid through patient premiums, not federal subsidies. In order to accomplish that, the Senate bill requires that anyone who selects a plan that covers abortion must pay $1 a month toward a segregated fund that would pay for abortion services. One plan in every state exchange must offer coverage that does not include abortions, so there would be an option for those who morally object to $1 of their premiums going toward abortion services. Legislators supporting the bill -- along with President Obama -- insist that segregation of funds stays true to the Hyde Amendment restriction on federal funds for abortions. The Senate bill's proposal on abortion is opposed by activists on both sides of the abortion issue. Abortion rights groups like NARAL Pro Choice America, the National Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood all put out statements denouncing the requirement that policy owners or their employers write separate checks -- one for abortion services and one for everything else. NARAL called the provision ""unacceptable bureaucratic stigmatization (that) could cause insurance carriers to drop abortion coverage, even though more than 85 percent of private plans currently cover this care for women."" Abortion foes like the National Right to Life Committee and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops also vehemently opposed the Senate bill's abortion language, arguing that if you send federal subsidies to a person who then chooses a plan that cover abortions, that's federal funding of abortion. They called the plan to segregate money so that abortions are paid only through premiums -- not government subsidies -- nothing more than a bookkeeping scheme. Until March 21, 2010, that was Stupak's consistent position. In a Fox News interview on March 17, 2010, Stupak said of the Senate bill, ""It is very clear that abortion is, for the first time ever, a funded benefit by the federal government."" So, what changed on Sunday that prompted Stupak to say ""there will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation""? In the hours leading up to the vote, he and several other antiabortion Democrats in the House agreed to back the health bill after Obama promised to sign an executive order reinforcing the commitment that no federal funds would be used for abortions. The Senate bill already spelled out strict payment and accounting requirements to accomplish that, but Obama's executive order went one step further, putting the president's weight behind specific measures to ensure that funds are properly segregated. By our reading, the order mostly restates and reinforces the intent of the Senate bill. But it doesn't fundamentally change the fact that people getting government subsidies for health care will be able to buy a policy on the exchange that covers abortions. That's why some abortion foes -- not all -- believe Stupak essentially traded his vote for a handful of beans. ""It was issued for political effect,"" said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee. ""We don't see any value in the order."" We don't think Rep. Stupak can credibly claim one day that the bill is federal funding of abortions, and then the next day, after getting the agreement on the executive order, that it does not. Stupak's issue all along was that if federal subsidies went to someone who could then choose a plan that covers abortions, that was federal funding for abortion. And that hasn't changed. The president's order spells out safeguards to ensure the funds are segregated. But if you thought that was a bookkeeping trick before, there's nothing in the executive order that would change your mind. At the climax of the health care debate from the floor, House Republican Leader John Boehner said that even with the executive order from the president, the Senate bill would provide ""taxpayer funding of abortions for the first time in 30 years."" We don't agree. It's understandable that abortion foes opposed a proposal that gives more people the opportunity to obtain insurance that cover abortions. But it's another thing to say those abortion services would be paid with federal dollars. The Senate bill states very clearly that public funding through tax credits and government subsidies for elective abortion services offered in the exchange is prohibited. But more than that, the bill sets up a mechanism to ensure that abortion services offered in the exchange are paid entirely from patient premiums, premiums paid by people who have chosen a private plan that covers abortion. The executive order puts the weight of the president's word behind providing a way to ensure two checks go to insurers every month, so that abortion dollars and federal dollars are not commingled. We think that's enough to back up Stupak's claim, ""There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation."" But that's a conclusion we reached before the president promised an executive order, back when Stupak disagreed with us and insisted the bill would have had federal dollars subsidizing abortions. We don't understand how the executive order changes Stupak's logic on this issue, but no matter how he arrived as his conclusion, we think he's right now. And we rule his claim True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/23/bart-stupak/stupak-says-there-no-federal-funding-abortion-sena/

Florida's Bill McCollum says health care lawsuit is bipartisan
","Florida Republican Attorney General Bill McCollum says politics isn't the reason for his legal challenge to the landmark health care bill signed into law by President Barack Obama.To help make the point, McCollum says the 22-page suit filed in a Pensacola federal court on March 23, 2010, is ""bipartisan."" ""This bipartisan effort by attorneys general around the country should put the federal government on notice that we will not tolerate the constitutional rights of our citizens and the sovereignty of our states to be trampled on,"" McCollum said in a press release announcing the lawsuit. ""This law represents an unprecedented encroachment on the liberty of the American people, and I will pursue this litigation to the highest court if necessary.""The lawsuit argues that the federal government cannot impose taxes or financial penalties on someone who fails to have health insurance.Given how polarized the health care debate has become, we wondered how ""bipartisan"" the suit truly was. Thirteen attorneys general have signed on. They are: Of that list, Caldwell of Louisiana is the lone Democrat. The rest are Republicans. There is no hard and fast definition of bipartisan, but it's quite a stretch to say one out of 13 is bipartisan. As a point of reference, consider two Congressional actions that are almost universally described as bipartisan -- the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and the 1996 welfare overhaul. Ninety-eight Democrats and 230 Republicans voted for the welfare reform package in the U.S. House. Another 25 Democrats joined 53 Republicans voting for the bill in the U.S. Senate. No Child Left Behind passed 381-41 in the House with 183 Republicans and 198 Democrats voting for it. It passed 87-10 in the Senate with the support of 44 Republicans and 43 Democrats. McCollum, who is running for governor, claims that his constitutional challenge of the landmark health care bill passed by Congress is a ""bipartisan effort."" That's pretty misleading when only one out of 13 attorneys general supporting the lawsuit is something other than a Republican. As such, we rate his claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/23/bill-mccollum/florida-bill-mccollum-health-care-lawsuit/

Schieffer's timely reminder on Iraq war has one problem
","Though it escaped notice amid a blizzard of activity on health care reform, March 19 marked the seventh anniversary of the invasion that began the Iraq war.Host Bob Schieffer noted that milestone during the March 22, 2010, edition of CBS's Face the Nation. ""March 19th was the seventh anniversary of the Iraq invasion, which began our longest war,"" he said.We wondered if it really has been America's longest war.We decided not to count the 46-year-long Cold War on the grounds that it belongs in a separate category. We also did not count situations in which U.S. military forces have remained in a long-term role long after the shooting has stopped, such as the U.S. military personnel stationed in South Korea for the last 55 years. Finally, we ignored battles that are popularly called ""wars"" but are usually not fought on military terms, such as the ""war on drugs.""To Schieffer's credit, it's worth noting that the Iraq war has indeed been longer than many of the United States' most significant military conflicts: the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II and the Korean War. That's not an inconsequential milestone.But we found at least three wars that were longer than the Iraq War. One is the Revolutionary War, which by the official Defense Department reckoning lasted from 1775 to 1783, or about eight years.The second is of much more recent vintage. U.S. military operations in Afghanistan began on Oct. 7, 2001, and are still going on, more than eight years later.The third is Vietnam. This one is harder to date, because it ramped up slowly. But the official dating is from Aug. 5, 1964 (around the time of the Tonkin Gulf resolution) to May 7, 1975 (shortly after the fall of Saigon). That's more than 10 1/2 years. If you date it only until the Paris peace accords on Jan. 27, 1973, then it would be about 8 1/2 years.So, all three of these wars have strong claims for being longer than the Iraq war.It's worth noting that answering this question is more art than science. James Bradford, a Texas A&M historian, points out that the American Revolution may have begun with the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) -- or earlier, with the breakout of hostilities at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Meanwhile, the end of the war could have been the the British surrender at Yorktown (Oct. 17, 1781), the signing of the Treaty of Paris (September 1783), the ratification of the treaty by the Continental Congress (Jan. 14, 1784), the ratification by King George III of England (April 9, 1784) or the exchange of the ratification documents (May 12, 1784).Another problem: ""It depends on how one conceptualizes a war,"" said Richard H. Kohn, a historian at the University of North Carolina. ""Afghanistan could be considered simply a campaign of the 'war on terror' if one accepts that as a war, just as Korea and Vietnam could be considered campaigns of the Cold War rather than separate wars.""Finally, no one knows when the Iraq War (or Afghanistan) will end. ""Maybe [Schieffer] figures Iraq will be the longest by the time we eventually leave, which of course is still possible,"" said Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla.So it's clear that this is not a black-and-white question. Still, we think there's enough evidence to say that the Iraq war was not America's ""longest war."" According to official Defense Department dating, the Revolutionary War, Vietnam and Afghanistan were (or are) all longer. So we rate Schieffer's statement False.",/factchecks/2010/mar/23/bob-schieffer/schieffers-timely-reminder-iraq-war-has-one-tempor/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney says hospitals, doctors, surgeries used more in U.S.
","While promoting his new book in an appearance on Fox News Sunday on March 7, 2010, Mitt Romney offered an interesting explanation of why health care costs so much in the United States. He said there are undoubtably some bad health insurance companies among the many in the United States, and they should be held accountable, but the industry is not the cause of increasing health care costs. ""The president is scapegoating. It's something which he is fond to do any time one of his programs gets in trouble. He decides to pick a target and say, 'This is the cause of America's problem,' whether that's Wall Street, or Goldman Sachs, or bankers, or wealthy people, or whether it's insurance companies,'' Romney said. ""To suggest that the overall health care cost of America, which, by the way, is dramatically higher than any other nation in the world, is because of the insurance companies is obviously quite silly.""Our health care costs are very, very high because we use a lot of health treatments. Hospitals, doctors, MRIs, surgeries and so forth are more extensively used and far more expensive in this country than they are in many other countries. It's not the insurance companies that are driving our health care cost up and up. The reason their premiums are going up is because doctor bills and hospital bills and usage and so forth is also going up.''       That's a lot to check -- hospitals, doctors, MRIs, surgeries --but we were game. We found that while Romney is correct in parts of the claim, he's wrong in others.Although ""many countries"" can be interpreted a lot of different ways, for the purposes of our analysis, we think it's fair to compare the United States with other economically developed countries in the world. Fortunately for our fact-checking, there's a group that compiles this data: the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, or OECD. They gather data from around the world on health, medicine, economics and other social indicators, and their statistics are widely respected. Let's start with hospitals. According to OECD data, Romney is correct about U.S. hospitals costing more, but wrong about them being more extensively used. As a percentage of the population, fewer Americans are admitted to hospitals, and spend less time in hospitals than the average country.The United States also has fewer hospital beds, with 3.1 beds per 1,000 people versus the OECD average of 5.7. The length of stay in a hospital for acute care is a full day less than in the average OECD country (5.5 versus 6.5 days), and the United States has 126.3 hospital discharges per 1,000 people versus the average 157.8. Discharges are used to measure the amount of visits to the hospital. Moving on to doctors, Romney is right again about what doctors are paid -- more in the United States -- but wrong that they're used more extensively. U.S. doctors are paid significantly more than the average doctor in other countries. The ""price"" includes fees and activities, so one reason U.S. doctors may be paid more is because they see more patients, but the OECD suspects that American doctors are largely paid more  because their fees are higher. Doctors in the United States are paid $25,000 to $40,000 more than those in Britain, Germany and Canada. However, there are fewer practicing physicians in the United States than the average, and American patients have doctor consultations much less often than citizens do in other countries monitored by the OECD.In the United States there are 3.8 doctor consultations per person annually, which is almost half of the 6.8 average of countries monitored by the OECD. A consultation includes general practitioners and specialists, and includes almost any type of environment in which you would consult a doctor. The only caveat is that this does not include people like registered nurse practitioners, who are allowed to prescribe medicine to patients but are not doctors.Romney is unquestionably correct when it comes to MRIs. Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides doctors with a detailed image of, for instance, cardiovascular damage. The United States gives the most MRI exams of all the countries monitored by the OECD, with more than twice the average amount of exams given per year and twice the average amount of MRI machines as a percentage of the population. The International Federation of Health Plans, a group of private insurers in different countries, reports that the United States has significantly higher fees than Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, France and Britain. The average fee for an MRI exam in the United States is $1,200. It is $179 in Britain, $235 in Spain, $567 in the Netherlands and $839 in Germany. Regarding surgery, the United States appears to have an above-average amount of in-patient surgeries and ambulatory surgeries. Ambulatory surgery is a component of what is considered a day surgery -- an operation in which the patient leaves the clinic or hospital the same day. The United States has 92.8 in-patient surgeries per 1,000 people annually versus the average of 68.3. According to the OECD, ambulatory surgeries are especially disproportionate, with the United States having a rate three times greater than the average country. The OECD does not have data on the amount of total surgeries in the United States, but all the available data suggest that it has a higher rate of surgeries than the average of the countries the group monitors.It's fairly well established that the United States spends more on health care than other economically developed countries, so high costs do not come as a surprise. Romney was right about MRIs, surgery, hospitals and doctors all costing more in the United States. Regarding quantity, he was also right about higher rates of MRI exams and surgery here, but wrong about hospital usage and doctor consultations. We're rating this Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/22/mitt-romney/romney-overstates-united-states-medical-costs-and-/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Crist and Democrats say Rubio is ""Miami lobbyist""
","The Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate campaign, trying to capitalize on the public perception that lobbying is unseemly, describes Republican Senate candidate Marco Rubio as a ""Miami lobbyist"" or ""Miami Lobbyist-Politician"" in its campaign literature.One recent reference appeared in a March 15, 2010, press release that carried the following headline: ""Marco Rubio: Can Florida Afford A Miami Lobbyist-Politician Who Laughs At Ethics?"" In the release, the word ""lobbyist"" was mentioned three times in reference to Rubio.The Florida Democratic Party also labels Rubio as ""a lobbyist"" in its press releases. In a March 21 statement e-mailed to reporters, the Democrats twice referred to Rubio as a ""lobbyist"" in criticizing him for not standing up to Tea Party activists.""Looks like Lobbyist Marco Rubio isn’t the only extremist Republican afraid to stand up to the Tea Party’s racial and homophobic slurs today,"" said the release, which included a story from Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, noting racial slurs hurled against members of Congress as they arrived to the House for the vote on health care reform. So was Rubio a Miami lobbyist? And is he still a Miami lobbyist?We first went to the Miami City database of lobbyists and found no such evidence, and called Miami City Hall as well. A clerk there searched and said there is no Marco Rubio listed as a lobbyist as far back as they keep records – to 2003.Next we went to Miami-Dade County, a separate, larger jurisdiction. It has an elaborate Guide to Lobbyist Registration that outlines ""applicable laws governing lobbyists doing business with the government of Miami-Dade County."" The procedures include registration, fees as well as a reporting requirement for when a lobbyist is no longer representing a client.There we found that Rubio registered seven times: three times in 1997, a year after he got out of law school, on mundane zoning and code enforcement efforts; twice in 1998 on behalf of a real estate effort and something called the American Sales & Management Org.; and once each in 2001 and 2002 as agent for companies listed as the Main Line Corp., a computer equipment company, and Pan American, a developer.Miami-Dade lobbyist registrar Keith Knowles told us the paper records of that period have since been destroyed – a common county hall practice, with no backup to microfilm or microfiche. But he said the county database still reflects accurate lobbyist filings, and that Rubio filed a form closing out his record as a lobbyist on May 31, 2005. (He served in the Florida House from 2000-2008.)So technically Rubio ceased to be a registered lobbyist with the county on May 31, 2005. But in fact, says Knowles, county records reflect that Rubio paid his last registration fee on April 26, 2002 -- $125 to represent Pan American, and did not renew the required lobbyist’s fee in October of that year, when his two-year $500 registration expired.To provide a little context, it appears that Rubio did some lobbying a year after he got his law degree and while serving as a commissioner in West Miami, a small city in the county. He kept his file active at County Hall during his first five years with the Florida Legislature although he did not have any lobbying clients after 2002. Rubio did some of this work while at the Becker & Poliakoff law firm. So we checked with partner Alan Becker, who confirmed that the last two registrations -- Pan American and The Main Line Corp -- were during Rubio's August 2001-June 2004 tenure there.Becker told us, ""I think it's a stretch to say he was a lobbyist. He was a lawyer representing clients who had issues involving government. But the law doesn’t distinguish and requires you to register as a lobbyist.""Rubio came to Becker's firm after working for Tew Cardenas, a well-connected lobbying and legal firm. While with Becker, Rubio rose to be majority leader in the Florida House. When Rubio left Becker's firm, for the Miami firm of Broad and Cassel, which did not lobby in Tallahassee, Rubio was in line to become speaker of the Florida House.Becker said the lobbying work done in 2001 and 2002 were ""very short representations"" before the county and that Rubio was primarily an attorney. ""As far as I was concerned I hired a lawyer who represented clients who often had governmental issues and that required you to register as a lobbyist."" (Becker gives to Republicans and Democrats and has contributed money to both the Rubio and Crist campaigns.) But Alex Burgos, Rubio's campaign spokesman, the lobbyist claim is a ""silly"" attack. In a statement last month to the  Miami Herald, he said that Rubio ""worked as an attorney for law firms that did Request for Proposal (RFP) and land use work in Miami-Dade County.""""Out of an abundance of caution, law firms engaged in this type of work often register their lawyers as lobbyists. In fact, all lawyers representing clients on land use matters are supposed to register as lobbyists. While Marco worked on land use contracts and RFPs, he never met with elected officials to influence them on behalf of clients,'' he told the Herald.So, we find that it's quite a stretch for Crist's campaign to call Rubio a ""Miami lobbyist,"" which conjures images of a high-priced lawyer representing fat-cat clients in Tallahassee or Washington. But that's misleading in two ways. The Crist campaign and Florida Democrats use the present tense, indicating that Rubio is a lobbyist. But he formally withdrew nearly five years ago. Also, his work was not what we traditionally think of as lobbying -- the Gucci-wearing attorney who seeks to influence the state Legislature or Congress. He worked at the local level, primarily on zoning matters.So we find the claim to be Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/22/charlie-crist/crist-and-democrats-say-rubio-miami-lobbyist/

Barbara Cargill says the Federal Reserve presided over a 95 percent decline in the U.S. dollar
","
The dollar ain't what it used to be, and State Board of Education member Barbara Cargill wants Texas students to know it. 
The board hammered out more than 300 proposed changes to the state's social studies curriculum in its January and March meetings, among them revisions to an economics course that touches on the role of the Federal Reserve in establishing monetary policy. 
Cargill, a former science teacher from The Woodlands near Houston, proposed an amendment requiring students to ""analyze the decline in the U.S. dollar since the inception of the Federal Reserve system in 1913."" 
When Gail Lowe, the board chair, asked Cargill if she'd like to speak to her amendment at the March 11 meeting, Cargill said: ""Well, I think it stands for itself. The Federal Reserve system has presided over a 95... percent decline in the U.S. dollar."" 
Board member Patricia Hardy questioned Cargill's statement: ""It's amazing how this board knows so much about so many different subjects but I think this is innately biased in its statement and there would be lots of economists who would have a question on the role in this way."" 
Another board member, Mavis Knight, asked: ""Is the Federal Reserve System the only reason why there has been a decline in the U.S. dollar since 1913?"" 
We wondered the same thing. In search of an answer, we first delved into the Fed's history. 
On Dec. 23, 1913, Congress created the the Federal Reserve System to serve as the nation's central bank. Its primary responsibility is to influence the flow of money and credit in the economy, returning all excess earnings to the U.S. Treasury. Currently, the system's seven board members, including Chairman Ben Bernanke, are responsible for U.S. monetary policy. They constitute a majority of the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions affecting the cost and availability of money and credit. 
But does that mean the Fed is responsible for the dollar's decline in value over 90-plus years? 
Cargill didn't respond to our inquiries. (Board members wound up approving a revision of her amendment stating: ""Analyze the decline in value of the U.S. dollar including abandonment of the gold standard."") 
Meanwhile, Dan Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, called Cargill's connection between the Federal Reserve and the declining dollar ""propaganda"" that ignores the impact of inflation from 1913 to 2010. 
The buying power of a dollar in 1913 would be almost $22 today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index inflation calculator. That matches up with Cargill's claim that the dollar has dropped in value by 95 percent. Then again, annual income per person is about $32,000 today, compared to about $400 in 1913 ($8,757 in 2010 dollars) — a hefty increase in earning power. 
Barry Bosworth, an economist at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, similarly said the Federal Reserve isn't responsible for the U.S. dollar's value, which he called ""pretty constant"" relative to other currencies. 
""The decline in the value of the dollar is the result of inflation, but advocates of the gold standard may argue that it could have been avoided if the U.S. had stayed on the gold standard, so they blame the Federal Reserve Bank,"" Bosworth said. The value of U.S. dollar was tied to gold until 1973, when the United States, switched from a system of fixed exchange rates to floating rates. 
In simple terms, inflation is when the price of goods and services rises and buying power erodes. Do Federal Reserve critics blame the Fed for that, too? 
Jesse Benton, a spokesman for Rep. Ron Paul, R-Lake Jackson, said the congressman agrees with Cargill's claim. Benton said that Paul, a former Libertarian candidate, believes inflation is caused by increases in the money supply — which the Fed controls — rather than prices going up. 
Dollar-driven ""inflation (then) causes a rise in prices,"" Benton said. ""We think that it's very important to keep that in mind."" 
Robert Auerbach, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas, former banking committee investigator and author of the book, ""Deception and Abuse at the Fed: Henry B. Gonzalez Battles Alan Greenspan's Bank,"" told us Cargill's amendment was misleading because it oversimplified both the dollar's and the Federal Reserve's history. 
Auerbach was trained by Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, one of two free-market economists who board members recently voted to add to the state's curriculum. In his career, Friedman famously championed killing inflation by keeping the supply of money growing at a steady but slow pace, though he later backed off that view, Auerbach said. 
Monetary policy offers two basic choices, Auerbach said: Letting the money supply grow, fueling inflation, or keeping the reins tight, which can cause severe recessions. 
""If you're limited from printing money, you'd put a huge number of people out of work,"" he said. 
Upshot: Cargill's correct that a dollar now has about 5 percent of the buying power it did in 1913, when the Federal Reserve System was created. That's basic math. Yet while a dollar now buys far less than in 1913, Americans also have far more earning power. And the dollar has generally held its value compared to other countries' currencies. 
The thrust of Cargill's statement is that the Fed presided over, or caused, that decline in value. In contrast, most experts we spoke with trace the decline to inflation over the years rather than specific actions by the Federal Reserve Bank. Though some Federal Reserve critics echo Cargill's point, such debates are best left to the economic experts who have waged them for decades. 
All in all, we rate her statement as Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",/factchecks/2010/mar/22/barbara-cargill/barbara-cargill-says-federal-reserve-presided-over/

Mayor Annise Parker says that for years, Houston has been spending more than it takes in
","
With the city of Houston running short about $11 million to fund its budget this year and projecting a revenue shortfall of $100 million for next year — Houston's first-year mayor, Annise Parker, recently floated the possibility of furloughs and layoffs for city employees. 
""For years now (in Houston), we have spent more money than we have taken in,"" Parker said March 10, according to a news article in The Houston Chronicle. ""You can't spend more than you earn. It is a very unbusinesslike approach to running things."" 
The Bayou City running in the red for years? We wondered if Parker, who was Houston's controller before she took office in January, has that right — especially because her predecessor as mayor, Bill White, touted his financial acumen while winning the 2010 Democratic nomination for governor. 
Janice Evans, Parker's director of communications, told us: ""The city has offset revenue shortfalls in recent years by drawing down the (general) fund balance, which was built up in good times so that it would be available during leaner times."" 
She was referring to the city's practice of socking away enough money so that the fund balance at the end of each fiscal year is equal to 7.5 percent of expenditures before debt service — essentially a savings account, which was built up over eight consecutive years. 
Michelle Mitchell, the city's finance director, said that starting in fiscal year 2009 — July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009 — revenue coming into the general fund has fallen short of expenditures. The general fund, which is the government's largest kitty, helps supports most basic services including health and human services, the police force and the fire department. 
""General revenues such as property tax, sales tax, came in lower than expenditures,"" Mitchell acknowledged in an e-mail. But she cautioned that ""there are other sources of funds that have to be looked at for the whole picture. These include funds such as sale of assets, proceeds from bonds, transfers from other fund sources, etc. With all revenues being considered, then the city did not outspend (its) revenues (prior to fiscal year 2009)."" 
Judy Gray Johnson, who served as Houston's finance director from 2004-2008, agreed with Mitchell's summary. 
""If you have higher fund balances at the end of the year than you had at the beginning of the year, than you couldn't have spent more than you took in,"" Johnson said. 
When White became mayor in 2004, the undesignated fund balance — money saved — was $83 million. The city last added to the fund in fiscal year 2008 which ended June 30 of that year. At that time the balance was about $287.2 million, according to the city's annual audited financial reports. In fiscal year 2009, there wasn't any extra cash to add to the general fund kitty. In fact, Houston's charter requires the city to keep a balanced budget, and for the past two years, the city has relied in part on reserve funds to satisfy the requirement. 
The city drew $26 million from the undesignated fund in fiscal 2009, lowering the balance to $261.1 million by June, 2009. 
Mitchell has projected the balance will drop to about $166 million by June 30 this year. 
Summing up: Houston took in more money than it spent for most of White's six-year tenure as mayor, and socked some of it away. Since fiscal 2009, the city has been drawing on those reserve funds, ending each year with less than it started. So far, it has drawn $56 million from the fund. 
Parker is correct that the city has spent more than it's taken in for years, though her time reference works only because the city's fiscal year always includes portions of two calendar years — in this case, 2008 and 2009. 
Put another way, the city has taken in less than it’s spent for about a year and a half, which includes one complete fiscal year and part of the current one. We rate Parker's statement as Half True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/21/annise-parker/annise-parker-says-years-houston-has-been-spending/

Texas Eagle Forum says Texas schools don't have to teach sex education
","
While making a case for abstinence-only sex education, the right-leaning Texas Eagle Forum recently declared that sex isn't a mandated topic in Texas schools. 
The group states in its March 11 ""News & Notes"" e-mail blast: ""In Texas, schools do not even have to teach sex education."" 
Teaching the birds and bees, optional? 
""In my understanding, it's a local level decision,"" said Pat Carlson of Fort Worth, the forum's Texas president. 
She pointed us to the state's education code, which requires each school district's board of trustees to establish a local school health advisory council, with at least five members, including parents, clergy and law enforcement officials. The council makes recommendations on the health curriculum taught in the district's schools. 
An excerpt from the law: ""Any course materials and instruction relating to human sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, or human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome shall be selected by the board of trustees with the advice of the local school health advisory council."" 
The law further states that ""before each school year, a school district shall provide written notice to a parent of each student enrolled in the district of the board of trustees' decision regarding whether the district will provide human sexuality instruction to district students."" 
Whether the district will provide human sexuality instruction? That doesn't sound like a requirement. 
However, schools do have to follow the state board of education's curriculum standards — Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills — according to a spokeswoman at the Texas Education Agency, which oversees primary and secondary public education. And that curriculum requires health teachers to teach sex education at appropriate grade levels. 
The state's guidelines for health classes state that in grades 9-10, for example, ""the student analyzes the relationship between unsafe behaviors and personal health and develops strategies to promote resiliency throughout the life span."" The student is expected to explore ""the relationship between the use of refusal skills and the avoidance of unsafe situations such as sexual abstinence... the importance and benefits of abstinence as it relate to emotional health and the prevention of pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases... discuss abstinence from sexual activity as the only method that is 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy,"" and so forth. 
On the one hand, it sounds like local school districts can opt out of teaching sex ed. On the other, it sounds like they're required to spell out the particulars. 
There's another wrinkle. Last year, state lawmakers voted to no longer require high-school students to take a health course to graduate. But a TEA spokeswoman told us schools are still required to offer the course. 
Confused? Apparently, so is the state education agency. 
""It's clear as mud, "" said David Anderson, the agency's legal counsel. ""There is some ambiguity that a school district has to teach parts of the state curriculum about human sexuality."" 
Anderson explained the history of this issue this way: ""When the curriculum was first written in 1995 — foundation curriculum and enrichment curriculum — and districts had to teach all of the foundation curriculum, like algebra, they did not have to teach every part of the enrichment curriculum. That's where health was."" 
Anderson noted that Attorney General Dan Morales issued an advisory opinion in 1998 stating that local school districts control the teaching of human sexuality in any enrichment curriculum (fine arts, foreign languages, technology, and health and physical education) — meaning school districts could choose not to teach sex ed. 
Anderson said lawmakers later amended state law to require districts to teach everything spelled out in state curriculum standards. Despite that change, Anderson said, local districts still control what — if anything — is taught about human sexuality. 
""It's at least an open question if a school board is required to teach some part of the health curriculum which some people might regard as sex education,"" Anderson said. ""My guess is districts are making their (sex education) decisions locally and people are happy with that."" 
The only unquestioned mandate that school districts must meet, said Anderson, is the parenting and paternity awareness program taught as part of high-school health classes. He added, ""But I'm not sure everyone would think that means sex ed."" 
We asked the attorney general's office to weigh in. Its spokesman, Jerry Strickland, declined, saying: ""We don't provide legal opinions lightly; because of that, this would truly be an issue for TEA."" 
When we asked Anderson plainly if schools are required to teach sex education, he said: ""It's not a yes or no answer."" 
How's this for clarity? If the responsible state agency cannot answer ""yes,"" there is no requirement. We rate Carlson's statement as True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/20/pat-carlson/texas-eagle-forum-says-texas-schools-dont-have-tea/

Tiahrt: Health care bill will collect 10 years of taxes for six years of services
","In the debate over health care reform, Republicans have often charged that the Democrats are cooking the books. In a House floor speech on March 16, 2010, Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., said that Democrats claim ""that the Obama health care bill will reduce the debt and help balance the budget, but reviewing those calculations shows that they’re going to collect higher taxes for 10 years and provide health care for only six years. Imagine that. Isn’t that a little misleading? Four years of health care taxes with no health care.""We decided to look at whether the Democratic bill does in fact provide just six years of coverage while drawing on 10 years of taxes.We'll begin by cautioning that health care experts -- including the nonpartisan arbiters at the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of the Actuary -- continue to pore over the newest version of the much-rewritten bill, leaving the analysis a work in progress. In addition, Tiahrt made his comments two days before the key analyses were released. But the broad outline of the bill was known at the time of his speech, and we do know enough to draw some conclusions.On a number of fronts, Tiahrt and his Republican colleagues are correct. But the comment does not tell the whole story.Two of the highest-profile and significant elements of the bill start in 2014. The virtual marketplaces known as the health care exchanges would start that year, enabling those who are uninsured or who do not have access to coverage through a large employer to buy affordable plans. Also starting that year would be subsidies to help people buy coverage on the exchange.In addition, that's the year for a major expansion in eligibility for Medicaid. And the shrinking of the ""doughnut hole"" -- the gap in Medicare drug coverage -- would be phased in over 10 years.And, yes, some of the tax provisions that help pay for the plan do start well before 2014. A 10 percent levy on indoor tanning would begin immediately, and an escalating annual fee on drugmakers would begin in 2011. Individuals with flexible spending plans and health savings accounts -- tax-advantaged accounts linked to health care expenses -- would also be hit with certain exclusions and limits beginning in 2011.However, the bill would also do many things immediately to boost coverage, while delaying the start of major new taxes until several years down the road.Some of the benefits that will be introduced within the first year:• Small business tax credits. From 2010 through 2013, qualifying small companies could get a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the company's contribution to employee health coverage. Beginning in 2014, when the exchanges start up, small businesses could qualify for up to 50 percent of the cost.• Coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. Soon after enactment, people with pre-existing conditions who haven't had coverage for at least six months could obtain coverage through a ""high-risk pool"" with subsidized premiums. This would be a temporary solution until the exchanges begin in 2014.• Assistance for early retirees. Starting in 2010, a temporary reinsurance program will help cut the cost of health coverage for retirees not old enough to be eligible for Medicare.• Dependent coverage to age 26. Shortly after enactment, all insurers will have to accept dependent coverage for children up to age 26.• No more rescissions. Existing plans would no longer be able to terminate beneficiaries when they get sick.• Enhanced preventive care. Soon after enactment, qualified health plans would have to provide certain preventive services without cost-sharing. Starting in 2011, patient cost-sharing for preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid will be eliminated.Meanwhile, some of the major tax changes will be delayed by a few years. • Medical device taxes. A new levy on medical device makers worth about $20 billion over 10 years kicks in in 2013.• Taxes to benefit Medicare Part A. The bill's hike of payroll taxes for individuals earning $200,000 or couples earning $250,000 and a new tax on unearned income for higher earners will start in 2013.• Insurance sector fees. Fees on health insurers totaling $67 billion over 10 years become effective in 2014.• Mandated coverage. Two of the bill's provisions most controversial to Republicans -- the requirement that individuals buy health insurance and that employers of a certain size offer affordable health insurance, under penalty of a fine -- would not begin until 2014. The individual mandate would start low that year and then phase in through 2016.• ""Cadillac tax."" The most recent version of the bill pushes back the tax on higher-cost health plans until 2018.According to the Joint Committee on Taxation -- Congress' bipartisan judge of revenue impacts from proposed laws -- the tax provisions collect minimal revenue for 2010, $2.9 billion for 2011 and $5.5 billion for 2012. They only start getting big in 2013, when revenues increase to $31.9 billion, eventually peaking at $86.9 billion in 2019.Indeed, of the total $409.2 billion in increased taxes over the 10-year window, only 10 percent of that amount is raised in the first four years -- the period when, according to Republicans, the government is collecting taxes without providing care.Meanwhile, on the coverage side, it's true that the cost increases significantly four years after enactment. According to CMS's Office of the Actuary, the first four years account for about 1 percent of the 10-year cost of increased coverage. So Tiahrt is correct that the bill's biggest expansions in coverage do not happen until 2014, including the exchanges, the subsidies and the Medicaid expansion. He's also right that some taxation begins well before that. But he makes it sound like all the taxes hit immediately and there are no significant benefits in the first four years. In fact, there are some benefits that begin immediately, and the taxes levied in the early years account for a small percentage of the total dollars involved. So we find his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/19/todd-tiahrt/tiahrt-health-care-bill-will-collect-10-years-taxe/

Obama says health reform legislation could reduce costs in employer plans by up to $3,000
","As the health care reform legislation heads toward a final vote, President Barack Obama has been out stumping hard for the plan, promising that if it passes, insurance premiums for most people will go down, at least compared to where they would be if the bill doesn't pass.""Americans who get their insurance through the workplace, cost savings could be as much as $3,000 less per employer than if we do nothing,"" Obama said in a health reform speech at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., on March 19, 2010. ""Now, think about that. That’s $3,000 your employer doesn’t have to pay, which means maybe she can afford to give you a raise.""We couldn't help but notice that this statistic is at odds with the forecast from the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that Obama has been so fond of citing in the health care debate.But the CBO is not where the president got his number. Rather, the White House told us he got this statistic from a November report commissioned by the Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs from some of the country's leading companies. The report, prepared by Hewitt Associates, a global human resources outsourcing and consulting company, states, ""We estimate that if enacted properly, the right legislative reforms could potentially reduce that trend line by more than $3,000 per employee, to $25,435.""As a baseline for its analysis, Hewitt assumed that if the government does nothing, health care costs will continue to rise at the same pace they have over the last decade -- just over 10 percent a year. By that measure, health care expenses for companies would rise 166 percent by 2019, a rate they conclude is ""not sustainable."" The report is not a line-by-line analysis of the bill now being considered by the House, but rather looks at reforms in a broader context, said MacKenzie Lucas, a spokeswoman for Hewitt. Nevertheless, the report did consider the legislation in play at the time, most of which remains in the bill now being considered, and concluded it ""provides opportunities for real savings."" Among the promising ideas included in the legislation, the report stated, are ""proposed delivery system reforms such as value-based purchasing, Innovation Centers to experiment with alternative methods of provider reimbursement, accountable care organizations, payment bundling, and financial penalties for avoidable hospital readmissions.""The report estimates these and other reforms ""could potentially reduce the rate of future health care cost increases by 15% to 20% when fully phased in by 2019.""The report includes this caution, however: ""This assumes the government implements the initiatives quickly, accurately, and consistently, and that private payers follow by implementing similar measures in a disciplined and timely way.""So that's the Hewitt report. But what about the report from the oft-cited Congressional Budget Office?In November, the CBO estimated that for the four out of five Americans who would get their insurance through their employer, the effect on premiums would be modest. Specifically, the CBO found that for people in the small group market, employers with 50 or fewer workers, the change in premiums would range from an increase of 1 percent to a decrease of 2 percent in 2016. In the large group market, premiums are projected to be zero to 3 percent lower in 2016 (relative to current law). That shakes out to a reduction of about $100 a year, at best, for single policies.So how do we get from the CBO's projected reduction of maybe $100 to Hewitt's $3,000?While Hewitt tried to quantify the long-term effects of some of the cost-saving pilot projects being tried in the health reform bill, and assumed their potential if they were fully implemented industry-wide, the CBO shied away from forecasting the effect of such programs. The CBO report states: ""The analysis does not incorporate potential effects of the proposal on the level or growth rate of spending for health care ... from the development and dissemination of less costly ways to deliver care that would be encouraged by the proposal. The impact of such 'spillover' effects on health care spending and health insurance premiums is difficult to quantify precisely, but the effect on premiums in 2016 would probably be small.""But that doesn't mean those provisions should be dismissed, said Len Nichols, director of the Center for Health Policy Research an Ethics and George Mason University.While the CBO lacked the necessary proof to forecast the effects of programs that have never happened before, the potential savings from reorganizing the health care system are significant, he said. Assuming those changes occur, the $3,000 figure cited by Obama is a ""pretty reasonable projection,"" Nichols said. Just don't expect those changes to affect your premiums any time soon. Some of them may be 10 to 20 years down the road, he said.""But if it's going to take 17 years, we need to start this afternoon,"" Nichols said. ""Either we realign the incentives, or we suffer the fate.""A couple qualifiers are in order here. First, none of the forecasts suggests premiums will be going down. Rather, the Hewitt report talks about premiums going up dramatically over the next decade, just not as much as if proper reforms are instituted. And the report is talking about long-term effects. The CBO doesn't think people getting insurance through an employer will see much change in premiums either way by 2016. And while the Hewitt report suggests significant reductions in health care costs could be achieved through meaningful health care reform, it doesn't say specifically that that is the case with the plan now before the House. And it provides lots of warnings about how things could go awry. In short, Obama is citing a very speculative report that doesn't speak directly to the legislation at hand. And it's a report that speaks to potential effects many years in the future. For more near-term effects, we think the CBO report is more definitive. But the Hewitt report does track a number of the provisions that were in the Senate plan in November, most of which are in the plan now before the House.

Florida Republican Party claims Democratic health care plan is government takeover
","If you've been following the health care debate, you've surely heard this line from Republicans: The Democratic plan is a ""government takeover"" of the nation's health care system. That's a potent talking point for the GOP because it conjures images of a sluggish, state-run bureaucracy. The Republican Party of Florida used it in a March 19, 2010, news release intended to pressure Democratic U.S. Rep. Allen Boyd, who represents a conservative district in north Florida, to vote against the bill. (It didn't work. He announced a few hours later he was supporting the bill.) The release said: ""This morning while Congressman Allen Boyd is deciding whether or not he’ll support the trillion dollar Obama-Pelosi-Reid government-run health care experiment, and since the voicemail boxes at his offices are full, the Republican Party of Florida decided to remind the Congressman of what some of his constituents had to say about the government takeover of nearly 20 percent of our economy."" The release had links to YouTube videos of people speaking against the plan at Boyd's town hall meetings. The RPOF's wording is slightly different than the most recent version we checked, when U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young made the claim in a speech to Pinellas County Republicans. But it's still just as wrong. Before we delve into the big reasons why it's wrong, we should note that the sentence has a tiny element of truth -- that health care accounts for nearly 20 percent of the economy. Indeed, the latest estimate by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that health care accounted for 17.3 percent of the economy last year and is expected to grow to 19.3 percent by 2019. But that's a thin gruel of accuracy in a false claim that has been repeated many times, despite being discredited by PolitiFact, FactCheck.org and other news organizations. By any reasonable definition, there's no way the Democratic plan could be considered a government takeover. Indeed, the plan's primary approach is to set up new systems to encourage private health insurance companies to compete to provide more coverage and better services. The cornerstone of the Democratic program is actually the status quo. The majority of Americans would continue to get health coverage the way they do now -- from private insurance companies. That coverage would be paid for the same way it is now -- by private employers and individual premiums. That's not a government takeover.The biggest change in the Democratic plan is the creation of health care exchanges that are supposed to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now -- people who are self-employed or work for small companies. The exchanges -- one in each state -- would be virtual marketplaces where people could shop for the best coverage. Although a government-run ""public option"" was included in the version of the bill that first passed the House, it is not in the current bill under consideration. The one significant element of the plan that would increase government's role in providing coverage is the expansion of Medicaid. Under the latest version, Medicaid would be expanded to cover anyone below 133 percent of poverty level. That's estimated to add about 18 million people to Medicaid rolls. Still, that's far short of a ""government takeover,"" a phrase that suggests a complete government-run health care system. So once again, we are faced with over-the-top rhetoric about the health care plan. It's perfectly legitimate to raise questions about the plan and the government's role, but it's wildly incorrect to label it a government takeover. Yes, the plan would expand the government's role, but it primarily would continue to rely on private insurers for the vast majority of Americans. And, for people who have trouble getting coverage, it would create a marketplace so people could shop for coverage from private insurers. It's ridiculously false to call that a government takeover. Once again, we need to strike a match and set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2010/mar/19/republican-party-florida/florida-republican-party-claims-democratic-health-/

Karl Rove says he and consultant David Weeks persuaded Rick Perry to switch parties and run for state agriculture commissioner
","Texas Gov. Rick Perry draws mention in GOP consultant Karl Rove’s autobiography with attention focused on Perry’s win for lieutenant governor in 1998 and Rove's role in his pivotal earlier switch from the Democratic to Republican party while he was a third-term member of the Texas House. Rove writes: “Rick Perry had planned to retire from the legislature until his best friend, David Weeks, and I talked him into switching parties and running for the GOP nomination for agriculture commissioner.” His book, ""Courage and Consequence, My Life as a Conservative in the Fight,"" was published March 9. We wondered if Perry’s 1989 party shift and his 1990 challenge to Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower played out so simply. Perry didn’t comment, but Weeks, a long-time Perry friend who’s been a consultant in Perry’s statewide campaigns, said Perry was seriously considering retirement, perhaps to become a lobbyist, partly because his wife, Anita, was saddled with raising their young children at the time. Weeks said Rove was part of a group of Republicans who encouraged Perry to switch parties and make the statewide run. “He wasn’t the only one,” Weeks said. Published stories also single out Weeks and Rove. Perry considered working as a lobbyist or high-level Capitol aide rather than leaving Austin entirely, according to a February article in the Austin American-Statesman. Instead, Weeks and others encouraged him to run for ag commissioner, the newspaper said. Perry told the Statesman: “I'll give David the bulk of the credit. He came and sat down with me and said, 'You ought to run for statewide office.'” According to a 2003 Rove profile published in Texas Monthly magazine, Rove and Weeks “persuaded Perry, an obscure Democratic legislator from Haskell who had co-chaired Al Gore's 1988 Democratic presidential primary campaign in Texas, to switch parties for the election. West Texas was swinging Republican anyway, and Perry, who was discouraged by his failure to advance in the House leadership and thinking of becoming a lobbyist, had nothing to lose.” The rest is dramatic Republican history: Perry, whose advisers included Rove, upset Hightower and has now held statewide office for nearly 20 years. Rove went on to help Bush to the White House. Others were involved, though, in Perry making his initial leap.

Rep. Tom Cotton says more terrorists have 'reached their targets' under Barack Obama than under George W. Bush
","
During a House floor speech just days after the Boston Marathon bombing, Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., sought to compare President Barack Obama’s record on terrorism unfavorably to that of Obama’s predecessor in the White House, George W. Bush. 
""I rise today to express grave doubts about the Obama administration’s counterterrorism policies and programs. ..."" Cotton said. ""In barely four years in office, five jihadists have reached their targets in the United States under Barack Obama: the Boston Marathon Bomber, the Underwear Bomber, the Times Square Bomber, the Fort Hood shooter, and, in my own state, the Little Rock recruiting office shooter. In over seven years after 9/11, under George W. Bush, how many terrorists reached their targets in the United States? Zero. We need to ask: Why is the Obama administration failing in its mission to stop terrorism before it reaches its targets in the United States?"" 
In the Boston attack, Dzokhar Tsarnaev has been charged with carrying out the bombing with his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed while being chased by police. 
As for the other terrorist plots Cotton referenced, here are brief summaries: 
Umar Farook Abdulmutallab became known as the ""underwear bomber"" on Dec. 25, 2009, after he tried to blow up a plane flying to Detroit using a bomb strapped to his underwear. He was convicted and is serving life in prison. 
Faisal Shahzad tried to plant a bomb in New York City’s Times Square on May 1, 2010. Bystanders discovered the bomb and the police were able to keep it from going off. Shahzad pleaded guilty and is serving life in prison. 
Nidal Hasan, a psychiatrist and major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, is the only suspect in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, that left 13 soldiers and civilians dead and more than two dozen others wounded on Nov. 5, 2009. Hasan is awaiting a military trial that could bring the death penalty. Prior to the shootings, the government intercepted at least 18 emails between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric tied to al-Qaida. 
Abdulhakim Muhammed, a convert to Islam who was born Carlos Bledsoe, pleaded guilty to killing Pvt. William Long and wounding Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula during a shooting outside a U.S. Army recruiting station in Little Rock, Ark., in 2009. He is now serving life in prison. 
However, Cotton’s comparison requires some creative accounting. Here are some of the problems with Cotton’s claim: 
• He ignores at least two post-9/11 examples of jihad-inspired terrorism under Bush that resulted in casualties. One is the July 4, 2002, incident in which Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, an Egyptian immigrant, fired on an El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two. The other is the March 2006 case of Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill graduate, driving an SUV onto campus, striking nine pedestrians, resulting in injuries but no fatalities. Both cases were reportedly motivated by radical Islam. 
• He uses inconsistent definitions of ""reached their targets."" ""Reached their targets"" can mean either ""reach the point of carrying out an attack"" or ""actually carrying out an attack."" 
If it’s ""reach the point of carrying out an attack,"" then Cotton is ignoring not just the two Bush-era examples above, but also the Dec. 22, 2001, ""shoe-bombing"" incident, in which Richard Reid was foiled trying to detonate plastic explosives packed in his shoes. It would be inconsistent for Cotton to exclude the shoe-bomber (who tried to strike during Bush’s tenure) when he includes the ""underwear bomber"" (whose plot came under Obama) when both were stopped before exploding their devices. 
If the standard is to ""reach the point of carrying out an attack,"" then we count three post 9/11 terrorist plots by Islamic radicals under Bush and five under Obama -- a difference, but not one as stark as Cotton’s calculation. If the standard is ""actually carrying out an attack,"" then the count would be two under Bush and three under Obama, which is even less of a difference. 
• Blaming the president for terrorist attacks on their watch has limited value. For starters, the nuts and bolts of preventing terrorist attacks is handled by career government officials in such agencies as the CIA and the FBI -- officials who are likely carrying out their duties regardless of who the president is. In addition, Cotton’s formulation doesn’t take into account plots in which arrests were made before aspiring terrorists have ""reached their targets."" 
When we raised some of these issues with Cotton’s office, a spokeswoman provided a rebuttal from the congressman. 
""Neither the Los Angeles airport shooter nor the UNC driver had a documented history of association with terrorist groups, as did the five attackers in the Obama years,"" the statement from Cotton said. ""As for the shoe bomber, he was a foreigner screened by a foreign agency (French) without significant American assistance and with a foreign target (international waters). By contrast, the underwear bomber was screened with American input and reached his target over a major American city (Detroit)."" 
Cotton’s statement continued, ""These three persons you cited from the Bush years hadn't been on a government list or subject to investigation, while all five attackers in the Obama years were. Finally, reaching the target means reaching the point of intended attack, not necessarily executing the attack. Counting on terrorist incompetence isn’t a sound counterterrorism strategy."" 
We should note that Cotton’s comments on the House floor didn’t include these kinds of qualifiers, but we decided to explore the merits of their argument anyway. 
We asked Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert who is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, what he thought of Cotton’s arguments. He said they have at least partial merit. 
As we have noted in a previous item, there are several cases under Obama in which future perpetrators of terrorists acts had already gotten themselves onto the U.S. government’s radar screen, including Muhammed, Hasan and Abdulmutallab, as opposed to none during the Bush years. Gartenstein-Ross says it’s reasonable to have greater concern about cases in which the government had looked into an individual but did not end up preventing an attack. A possible counter-argument is that the lack of a ""documented history of association with terrorist groups"" that Cotton cites could instead be considered a reflection of poor intelligence work. 
Advance suspicion that an individual might be a terrorist could be a point of distinction between the shoe bomber and the underwear bomber, he added, since the underwear bomber’s father sent the U.S. an urgent warning and nothing equivalent happened with the shoe bomber. On the other hand, we doubt the shoe bomber, as Cotton suggests, intended to attack international waters; his target, like the underwear bomber’s, was a U.S.-based airline filled with passengers, many of them Americans. 
Ultimately, Gartenstein-Ross said, it is an ""appropriate question to ask"" whether the Obama administration has ""in some way put into place policies that hamper investigations or aggressive action."" Still, he said, the congressman’s statement was, ""like a lot of rhetoric, overheated."" 
Our ruling 
Cotton said, ""In barely four years in office, five jihadists have reached their targets in the United States under Barack Obama,"" compared to zero ""in over seven years after 9/11 under George W. Bush."" Cotton’s math is inconsistent and stacked against Obama -- and there’s a limit to how fairly a comparison like this reflects what an administration can accomplish in counter-terrorism. On balance, we rate Cotton’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/apr/26/tom-cotton/rep-tom-cotton-says-more-terrorists-have-reached-t/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Eric Cantor']","
Eric Cantor says FAA could cut funds to avoid furloughs
","
With frustrated travelers tapping their feet in the nation’s airports this week, politicians responded with alarm to flight delays brought on by federal budget cuts. 
Beginning Monday, April 22, 2013, furloughs of air traffic controllers began to take effect under sequestration, a deficit-reduction measure that bluntly cuts federal agency budgets. The furloughs triggered flight delays around the country as the FAA scaled back the number of planes that could take off and land because the agency had fewer controllers to direct them. 
U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., joined the criticism that the FAA is maximizing the budget cuts’ inconvenience on travelers. 
""Why is President Obama unnecessarily delaying your flight? FAA could cut other spending,"" Cantor tweeted on April 23, 2013. 
The FAA has said it made all the cuts it could but sequestration still leaves no option but to furlough employees. 
So who’s right? We decided to check it out. 
Cuts & furloughs 
We looked into a similar claim from Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood before the sequester took effect. The Obama administration and federal agencies were warning that flight delays would result. 
Sequestration is forcing the FAA to carve $600 million from its budget, and LaHood said furloughing air traffic controllers was the last step after every other cut has been made. 
But air traffic controllers make up a big chunk of the FAA’s workforce: 15,000 of its 47,000 employees. 
""We’re looking at everything possible; and everything possible that’s legal, we will do,"" he said at the White House. That includes cutting travel, cutting overtime, freezing hiring, canceling conferences and reducing contracts. 
So what exactly is legal to cut? 
The Budget Control Act of 2011, the law authorizing the sequester, says ""each non-exempt account within a category shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the baseline level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate a breach within that category."" (That clause comes from a similar deficit control law from 1985, the first time ""sequestration"" was implemented.) 
It means, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget, that sequestration ""must be applied equally at the program, project, and activity level within each budget account."" 
That’s why officials and politicians call sequestration a blunt instrument. 
""The sequester language does not allow us to move funding from account to account, and we simply can’t make the required cuts without facility closures and furloughs,"" DOT spokesman Justin Nisly told PolitiFact in February. 
A $474 million FAA grant? 
Cantor’s tweet included a link to a Wall Street Journal editorial criticizing the Obama administration for flight delays and spending decisions. 
It pointed to a $474 million grant program posted this week on DOT’s website that promises to ""make communities more livable and sustainable."" 
""How about awarding grants to the control towers at Hartsfield and O'Hare?"" the editorial said. 
Nisly said the grant program ""was specifically designed by Congress as a rigorous competition to fund projects that have a significant impact on the nation, a region or metropolitan area. The program has been wildly popular, and the DOT has received more than $105 billion in applications for only $3.1 billion available. Each round of TIGER involves a detailed application and a thorough review of the merits of each project."" 
Merits aside, FAA grant programs are entirely excluded from sequester cuts. 
""Under the rules of the sequester, the airport grant program was exempted, as were all grant programs ... of the Department of Transportation. What that means is that it falls disproportionately on the operating side of the budget,"" FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told a House subcommittee this week. 
The editorial also mentioned $500 million the agency is spending on consultants. But FAA officials have said that money pays, not for consultants, but for contracts that support the air traffic control system, including telecommunications and weather radar. 
As we were working on this report, the earth moved a little under this issue. Five days into the furloughs, the Senate unanimously passed a bill allowing the FAA to move funds around and end furloughs. The House approved the legislation a day later. (Cantor voted for it.) As of this writing, it awaits Obama’s signature; he is expected to sign it. 
""Congress just passed legislation that now enables the FAA to have the flexibility it needs to make less disruptive changes, so clearly there was something in the law that was posing a problem,"" said Clifford Winston, an economist with the Brookings Institution. 
Our ruling 
Cantor said flights were being delayed unnecessarily because the FAA could have cut other funds before furloughing air traffic controllers. 
But the law authorizing sequestration states that cuts must be applied equally. Given that the FAA is a huge federal agency tasked with cutting $600 million, to say there is no wiggle room is a stretch. But sequestration does not allow elimination of entire programs or departments to spend the money on in other areas, such as paying air traffic controllers. 
What’s more, the fact that Congress was compelled to act to give the FAA that flexibility undercuts the argument that the agency could have moved funds around all along.

Thanks to Florida tax rules, it's better to be picked No. 2 in the NFL draft this year
","
Don’t get us wrong: We love analyzing tax policy and following legislative gamesmanship as much as the next political junkie. 
But we like our work even more when we get to pull in sports and pop culture. And when our Twitter feed dangled a widespread claim combining Florida’s income tax (or, lack thereof) and football on the first night of the NFL draft, we could not resist giving it a second look. 
In a tweet shared by more than 3,600 users, ESPN reporter Adam Schefter wrote: ""Odd fact for odd draft: No. 2 overall pick will earn more than the No. 1 pick due to no state tax in Florida. So 2 not so bad."" 
The Kansas City Chiefs had the top pick, and the Jacksonville Jaguars got the second. We wondered if Texas A&M offensive lineman Luke Joeckel, headed for Jacksonville, will really make more after income taxes than the draft’s No. 1 pick, University of Central Michigan offensive lineman Eric Fisher, who is going to Missouri. 
Twitter helped our mission from the start. A user named @SportsTaxMan, New Jersey-based sports and entertainment accountant Robert Raiola, responded to Schefter’s tweet with even more detail. 
""Eric Fisher was picked 1st by #Chiefs The #Jaguars, selected Luke Joeckel. Luke will get approx $285K > after tax than 1st pick,"" he tweeted. 
How’d he figure that? 
Reached by phone, Raiola called the instance of the No. 2 pick’s after-tax pay exceeding No. 1 after-tax pay ""an anomaly"" in this year’s draft. 
His method involves some eyeballing. Since we don’t know for sure what these players’ salaries and signing bonuses will be, he used last year’s contracts for the top two picks (quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III, respectively). 
There isn’t likely to be a big dollar difference between the top two picks in 2013 because of rules regarding rookie contracts that were adopted as part of the NFL’s 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement. The minimum base salary for a rookie player is $405,000 in 2013, up from $390,000 in 2012. 
The big money comes in the form of a signing bonus. 
Counting base pay and a signing bonus in the first year of their deal, Luck received $14.9 million, and Griffin got $14.1 million. 
Now fast forward to this year. 
Florida has no state income tax. Missouri has a 6 percent tax on income over $9,000, and Kansas City, Mo., has a 1 percent tax on top of that. So Raiola figures that if Fisher makes $14.9 million, he will pay a little more than $1 million in state and city income taxes -- dropping his pay (pre-federal tax) to about $13.85 million. 
That’s less than Joeckel’s expected pre-federal tax haul. 
There is one complicating factor. Professional athletes pay ""jock taxes"" when they play in certain states and cities on the road. Technically, they’re working in the state in which they are playing when they go on the road, Raiola said. It creates headaches for athletes but isn’t a huge drain given their high incomes, he said. (You can read about how the jock tax got its start, here. It's an interesting story.) 
He assumes each NFL away game counts for two duty days. Jacksonville has seven preseason and regular season games on its 2013 schedule in states and cities that have a jock tax: the Atlanta Falcons, New York Jets, Oakland Raiders, Denver Broncos, St. Louis Rams, Cleveland Browns and the Indianapolis Colts. Assuming a 7 percent tax rate, jock taxes will cost Joeckel approximately $99,000. (He won’t pay the tax when he plays the Tennessee Titans, Seattle Seahawks or the Houston Texans). 
After taking out federal, state and local income taxes, Joeckel comes out approximately $285,000 ahead of Fisher, according to Raiola. 
But Joeckel isn’t even the luckiest top pick in Raiola’s eyes. That distinction goes to defensive end Dion Jordan, who was drafted by the Miami Dolphins after the team traded up to get the No. 3 pick. ""The trade to Miami will save him approx $1.7M in state tax in 2013,"" he tweeted. (That comparison is with the tax situation in Oakland, Calif., because the Oakland Raiders had held the third draft pick.) 
Now for some caveats. This analysis focuses on income tax. Florida’s overall state and local tax burden, as measured by the Tax Foundation, is a bit higher than Missouri’s, mainly because of property taxes. Using a few cost-of-living calculators, we found Jacksonville is still cheaper to live in than Kansas City. A $500,000 salary goes about $30,000 further in Jacksonville than Kansas City. 
There’s also no telling if these newly minted millionaires will take any number of actions that would affect their tax bill, including buying a house, socking money away into a 401(k) savings account or any number of credits and deductions they could take. 
But if we accept that we’re talking approximations -- and if we assume they live in the state they play in --  we found some agreement. 
""If we just look at the after-tax pay, that comparison is accurate,"" said Saku Aura, University of Missouri public economics associate professor. ""A state without an income tax, like Florida, will be always attractive from a very high-income individual's perspective."" 
Even though Joeckel did not have a choice about moving to Jacksonville, some free agents may consider income tax as a factor in their decision to come to another team. Cornerback Darrelle Revis was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this week from the New York Jets, a move Raiola thinks will save him roughly $1,435,000 in state income tax. 
Of course, an income tax levied against an athlete is probably not going to lead to many tears -- from athletes, or the rest of us. 
""I guess I don’t have that much sympathy given that there are a whole host of people who would like to be in either of their positions,"" said Kim Rueben, Tax Policy Institute senior fellow. 
Our ruling 
ESPN’s Adam Schefter merged the worlds of the NFL and tax policy on the first day of the NFL draft when he said that No. 2 pick Luke Joeckel will take home more pay than No. 1 pick Luke Fisher because Florida has no state tax. 
When looking at income tax, Schefter is largely right. If the 2013 salaries hold at about their 2012 levels, which is part of new NFL rules, Joeckel is better off financially by being selected No. 2 by a Florida team than being picked No. 1 somewhere else. 
There are two caveats. First, the salaries of Joeckel and Fisher are not yet officially known. Also, there are some other ways to look at income that could affect the bottom for Joeckel and Fisher -- whether it be sales taxes or property taxes or overall cost-of-living. 
We rate Schefter’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/26/adam-schefter/nfl-reporter-says-no-2-pick-nfl-draft-will-earn-mo/

Business group leader says businesses pay roughly 60 percent of taxes in Texas
","
As taxpayers faced the deadline for federal returns, Texas Gov. Rick Perry called for $1.6 billion in tax cuts for businesses in Texas. 
His proposal was ""right and proper,"" business leader Bill Hammond said at Perry’s April 15, 2013, press conference, because ""Texas businesses pay roughly 60 percent of all taxes that are paid in Texas today."" 
PolitiFact Texas checked a similar statement in 2011, rating as Mostly True a state senator’s claim that businesses ""pay most of the taxes"" in Texas. 
Do businesses currently pay 60 percent? 
Hammond told us by phone that he intended his remark to encompass both state and local taxes. 
Generally, businesses in Texas shoulder a higher-than-average initial tax burden because the state is one of only nine with no income tax on individuals. Experts agree, though, that the burden eventually shifts to individuals as businesses raise prices, lower wages or send less profit to shareholders. 
In our 2011 fact-check, we looked at a report the Texas state comptroller publishes every two years predicting how much Texas will pull in from the state taxes that recently generated more than 2.5 percent of revenue. State law also requires the report to estimate how much will be paid in local school property taxes, although those are determined by and paid to individual districts, not the state. 
The report breaks out the (predicted initial) impact each tax has on businesses and consumers -- i.e., how much they pay. The latest report, published March 7, 2013, examined: 
Four taxes paid entirely by businesses -- franchise tax (the main tax on businesses’ revenues), natural gas tax, insurance premium tax and oil production tax. 
One tax paid entirely by consumers -- cigarette tax. 
Four taxes shared by the two groups -- sales tax, gasoline tax, motor vehicle sales tax and school property tax. 
Looking ahead to Texas’ fiscal year 2015 -- the 12 months ending Aug. 31, 2015 -- the comptroller predicted businesses would pay $37.2 billion (52 percent) with consumers paying $34.9 billion (48 percent). 
Comptroller’s spokesman R.J. DeSilva told us the eight state taxes in the report accounted for about 92 percent of state tax revenue in fiscal 2012. 
But there are other taxes Texas businesses pay, including city and county property taxes that, like school property taxes, don’t flow into state coffers. 
Dick Lavine, senior fiscal analyst with the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us by email, ""I hate to be making Hammond's case, but the bulk of the Comptroller's study includes only the major state taxes."" 
Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association business group, said by email that the taxes left out of the comptroller’s report -- even if they’re only 8 percent of total revenue -- fall primarily on businesses. Examples he gave: taxes on ""diesel, alcohol, tobacco excise (other than cigarettes), utility taxes, hotel taxes."" 
Another major cost to businesses, Craymer said, is the state’s unemployment insurance tax -- money collected from employers under state law and redistributed by the Texas Workforce Commission as benefits to unemployed Texans. 
As in our earlier story, Hammond and Craymer each recommended a report -- ""the most comprehensive comparative study,"" Craymer said -- done by consultants Ernst & Young for the Council on State Taxation, a Washington-based trade association representing corporate businesses. 
Spokesman Robert Wood at the Texas Association of Business, which Hammond heads, emailed us the council’s 2009 report on state and local tax burdens, which said that businesses paid nearly 61 percent of Texas taxes in the state’s fiscal 2008. 
A co-author of the report, Andrew Phillips at Ernst & Young, told us by email that according to their calculations, businesses paid about 60 percent of Texas taxes in fiscal 2009 and 61 percent in fiscal 2010 and 2011. 
Because those percentages were noticeably higher than our comptroller-based percentage, we drilled down into the results. 
Phillips pointed out several differences between the two estimates. As noted above, the comptroller was projecting ahead to 2015, whereas Ernst & Young was speaking to years in the recent past. 
He said Ernst & Young tabulated not just school property taxes but all local property taxes reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, adding up to a total $39 billion in fiscal 2011. Also, Ernst & Young included $2.4 billion in unemployment insurance tax paid by businesses in fiscal 2011, Phillips said. 
Hammond said, ""The point is that businesses in Texas do pay, by any measure, more taxes than individuals and homeowners pay in Texas. ... We obviously believe that the Ernst & Young study is more correct for the last few years."" 
Our ruling 
Hammond said businesses pay roughly 60 percent of the state’s tax bill. 
By our calculations using state projections that do not take into account all taxes, businesses will pay 52 percent of taxes in the state in 2015. In contrast, Hammond’s source, a national group representing corporations, calculates that businesses paid 61 percent of all taxes in Texas in fiscal 2011. 
So, estimates vary because different taxes are considered. Keeping in mind, too, that businesses offload many expenses including taxes, we rate Hammond’s claim as Mostly True.

Social Security doesn't add to the federal deficit, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan says
","
In a move that upset liberals, President Barack Obama proposed in his 2014 budget a change to something called ""chained CPI,"" which would result in smaller increases in future Social Security benefits. 
Among those objecting -- at a news conference outside the White House a day before Obama officially made the proposal -- was U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis. 
The freshman congressman elaborated on his position a week later, in an April 16, 2013 interview with John ""Sly"" Sylvester, a liberal talk show host on WEKZ-FM (93.7) outside of Madison.   
And he made this statement: 
""Social Security didn't cause our deficit. Not one dime gets added to the deficit because of Social Security. It's not allowed to, by law."" 
The one-dime claim -- likely to be repeated in one form or another as Congress debates Obama’s proposal -- is about as absolute as it gets. 
Is Pocan right? 
‘Chained CPI’ 
Currently, cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security benefits are calculated using the traditional Consumer Price Index, a measure of overall inflation. 
Obama wants to switch to the so-called chained CPI, which some analysts believe is a more accurate measure. It accounts for how people change their behavior when costs rise -- if the price of pasta goes up, you might buy cheaper rice instead. 
Chained CPI would save the government some money because it would trigger smaller Social Security benefit increases than the traditional CPI. 
If chained CPI were put in place in 2014, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the average Social Security benefits would be roughly 2 percent lower -- $30 a month -- by 2023. 
Pocan’s evidence 
Pocan, a former state legislator, arrived in Congress in January 2013. He won election to the House seat vacated by Democrat Tammy Baldwin, who ran successfully for the U.S. Senate. 
To support Pocan’s claim, Pocan spokesman Samuel Lau cited federal documents from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Congressional Research Service to make two points: 
1. Social Security runs a surplus, and therefore doesn’t contribute to the overall federal deficit. 
2. Social Security benefits can be paid only from the Social Security trust fund, not general funds. 
But there is more to the story. 
Andrew Biggs, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and former principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration, explains it this way: 
Budget experts use two main measures of the budget deficit: the ""on-budget"" balance, which includes everything except Social Security and the postal service, and the ""unified budget,"" which merges the on- and off-budgets. 
The unified budget approach is by far the most common for budget experts and the media -- and when the Obama White House talks about a 2013 budget deficit of $901 billion, it's the unified budget deficit that's being cited. 
On a unified budget basis, when Social Security's financial position worsens, the budget deficit grows. Social Security contributes about $53 billion to the budget deficit. 
But let’s go a little deeper, relying on experts such as the Tax Policy Center’s Howard Gleckman and the work of our PolitiFact colleagues and the Washington Post Fact Checker. 
Social Security’s red ink 
Although Social Security used to run surpluses, over the past few years it hasn’t collected enough in taxes to pay in benefits. 
And the trust fund consists not of prior Social Security surplus funds, but of interest-bearing securities provided through federal government borrowing -- thus the link to the deficit. 
Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system: Payroll taxes paid by current workers and their employers go to pay benefits to current retirees and other Social Security recipients. 
From 1984 to 2009, Social Security collected more money in payroll taxes than it paid out in benefits. That surplus was transferred from the Social Security program to the federal government's general fund. In return, the Treasury gave Social Security bonds that it could redeem to pay future benefits. 
The government, in turn, incurred obligations to repay the bonds, plus interest, to the Social Security trust fund. 
Since 2010, Social Security has been paying more in benefits than it has collected in payroll taxes. To meet its payments, Social Security began redeeming the bonds, plus interest, from the federal government. 
In other words, money was transferred from the government’s general fund to Social Security. 
That has an impact on the government’s deficit because the Treasury has had to borrow money in order to make such a transfer. 
Pocan noted that in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2012, Social Security had a $36 billion surplus. But he ignores the fact that Social Security had to tap its trust fund. 
A closer look shows that Social Security actually had a cash flow deficit and used roughly $110 billion in interest to help make benefit payments. 
Because the government had to borrow money in order to pay the interest to Social Security; that contributes to the federal deficit. 
Indeed, White House figures show the Social Security shortfalls contributing to the overall federal deficit. And Obama has acknowledged that Social Security adds to -- though isn’t the primary driver of -- the deficit. 
Our rating 
Pocan is not the first to claim that Social Security does not contribute to the federal government’s budget deficit. Nor even the most recent. Two days after Pocan made his statement, Baldwin said on C-SPAN: ""Social Security has not contributed one penny to our current deficit or debt."" But unlike Pocan, she noted the government has used ""other taxpayer funds"" when payroll taxes weren’t enough to pay Social Security benefits. 
In 2011, 2012 and 2013, our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas, Georgia and New Hampshire examined claims similar to Pocan’s. Each reached the same rating: Mostly False. 
And that’s what we rate Pocan’s statement.",/factchecks/2013/apr/26/mark-pocan/social-security-doesnt-add-federal-deficit-us-rep-/

Forbes says U.S. attack sub fleet will sink below 48 boats Navy needs for missions
","
U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th, has never been shy about seeking money for the Navy. He represents a district that’s anchored in Hampton Roads, home to the world’s largest naval base and two of the nation’s busiest shipyards. 
In an April 9 op-ed, Forbes and Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., called for more funding to replace the nation’s aging fleet of attack submarines, or SSNs. The column appeared on AOL Defense, a website that describes itself as ""the idea hub of the U.S. defense world."" 
Forbes and Courtney wrote, ""The Navy has stated it requires 48 SSNs to execute current missions, but given the current rates of replacement, the SSN force is scheduled to drop below the stated minimum in less than a decade."" 
They wrote, ""All Americans should be gravely concerned"" by the loss of national security that will be caused by the diminution of the fleet. The attack subs, which cost about $2.6 billion apiece, are sent on a variety of missions, including intelligence, mine warfare, anti-submarine, anti-ship, small-scale special forces insertion and land target strikes. 
We decided to check their claim that the number of attack submarines is scheduled to fall below the Navy’s required level in less than a deacde. Forbes’ office referred us to two studies published in March by the Congressional Research Service and documents from the Department of Defense in 2010 and 2012. 
The Navy, since 2006, has said it needs 48 attack submarines to carry out its missions, according to a CRS report released March 27. So Forbes is right on that part of his claim. 
The Navy now has 55 attack subs, but these nuclear-powered vessels have about a 30-year lifespan. In a nutshell, the SSNs are scheduled to be retired during the next 22 years at a faster pace than the nation will replace them. The Navy’s long-range plan calls for scrapping about three submarines annually for a number of years and replacing them with one or two new subs. 
Forbes based his column on Navy projections released last year. They showed that the number of attack subs would sink below the 48-ship standard in 2022 and not resurface to that level until 2035. Forbes’ claim that the fleet would fall below the Navy’s stated need ""in less than a decade"" was based on the best information available at the time his op-ed was published. 
The Navy has since updated its 30-year projections to fit into the federal budget proposed by President Barack Obama on April 10. The Navy said its attack sub force wouldn’t fall under the 48-ship threshold until 2025 and would stay below that level for 10 years. The Navy would hit bottom in 2029, with 42 SSNs. 
Forbes, who is chairman of the House Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, has scheduled hearings on the Navy’s shipbuilding plan. He has urged Congress to ensure that at least two new attack subs are produced every year. 
The decline in the SSN fleet, Forbes says, particularly threatens U.S. intelligence and security operations in East Asia and the Western Pacific, where China is becoming increasingly dominant. 
Eric Wertheim, author of ""Combat Fleets of the World"" and an expert on global sea power, told us it’s hard assess the degree of threat the reduction of the SSN fleet poses to U.S. security. 
""What the Navy and military are trying to do is have a balanced force,"" he said. ""They plan to respond and be ready for any kind of operation, whether it’s low-intensity, such as Libya, peacetime activities, like intelligence or a high-intensity operation, such as is possible with places like China."" 
Wertheim said it doesn’t necessarily mean that the U.S. won’t be able to carry out missions with a reduced attack sub fleet but, in military planners’ minds, there are increased risks that it won’t be able to respond to all threats. 
""The question for them is what amount of risk are we willing to take,"" he said. ""We don’t know what we’ll need until the future comes."" 
Our ruling 
Forbes wrote that the nation’s fleet of attack submarines is scheduled, in less than a decade, to fall below the 48 boats the Navy says it needs to carry out current missions. 
The congressman accurately cited the best information that was available when his column was published on April 9. Since then, the Navy has issued new projections that say the fleet won’t fall below 48 SSNs until 2025. 
We don’t fault Forbes for not knowing information that wasn’t available at the time. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/26/randy-forbes/forbes-says-us-attack-sub-fleet-will-fall-below-na/
"['Georgia', 'Guns', 'Johnny Isakson']","
Weighing Isakson’s consistency on gun checks
","
The recent legislation in the U.S. Senate to expand background checks on guns was one of the highest-profile votes this year. 
The measure eventually failed on a 54-46 vote. Senate rules required it to get at least 60 votes in order to succeed. But some gun advocates were angry the measure even came up for a vote. 
Some PolitiFact Georgia readers wrote to us, asking whether U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., flip-flopped on an earlier position when he voted to allow that vote to go forward in the Senate. Isakson voted against the actual background check bill. 
PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether Isakson staked out one position on a background-check filibuster and then reneged. 
President Barack Obama called for several new measures aimed at limiting access to guns to criminals and the mentally ill after the horrific killings in December at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. One proposal was universal background checks. 
Federal law currently requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks, commonly known as ""universal background checks,"" before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers to do such background checks. A handful of states (Georgia is not one of them) require private dealers to conduct background checks. Gun control advocates want to require private dealers to conduct such a check. 
Earlier this month, two senators who’ve received high marks from the National Rifle Association (Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania), proposed an amendment they hoped would receive wide bipartisan support from their colleagues. The amendment would subject nearly all gun buyers to background checks. 
Isakson said during an interview April 9 with ""CBS This Morning"" that he had concerns about such legislation, including that background checks may ""violate rights to privacy in terms of mental health."" Isakson received an ""A"" rating from the NRA in his last campaign, The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. 
But the senator, unlike many of his GOP colleagues, indicated he didn’t want a filibuster on the proposal. A filibuster allows unlimited debate continued on the grounds that any senator should have the right to speak as long as necessary on any issue. 
""I think it deserves a vote up or down, "" Isakson said in the CBS interview. 
On April 11, the Senate voted 68-31 in favor of the ""motion to proceed"" on the gun bill, allowing it to come to the floor and have amendment votes. Isakson voted in favor of moving forward. So, too, did Georgia’s other U.S. senator, Saxby Chambliss, a Republican. 
But Republicans could still have blocked the bill after it was amended by setting up another 60-vote hurdle to end debate. As a vote on the Manchin/Toomey amendment and others drew closer, the thinking on Capitol Hill was that the measure could not get 60 votes once the NRA announced its opposition. The Washington Post reported that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, decided to allow votes on nine amendments, requiring a 60-vote majority in order for them to pass. Any of those amendments could have been filibustered on their own if the vote threshold was set at 51. In addition, it allowed Reid to control the action. 
""So, why didn’t Reid try to get the unanimous consent agreement to set all amendment votes at a 51-vote threshold?"" The Post wrote. ""Because to do that would have opened the bill up to the very likely possibility that amendments favored by gun rights advocates would be added to it."" 
On April 17, Isakson and Chambliss voted against the actual amendment. The Senate voted 54-46 in favor. Again, it did not receive the 60 votes necessary for it to more forward. 
Georgia Gun Owners, a group that claims about 10,000 members, held a protest in front of Isakson’s home after he voted in favor of bringing the amendment to a floor vote. 
""He certainly didn’t flip-flop on the filibuster,"" said Patrick Parsons, the group’s executive director. ""He never said he wanted to (support a filibuster)."" 
Jerry Henry, executive director of Georgia Carry, a 7,300-member gun advocacy group, said he was not aware of Isakson supporting a filibuster on the amendment. 
""He voted to kill the filibuster and allowed it to get on the floor and then he voted against the bill,"" Henry said. ""As far as I know, (Isakson) said he would not support a filibuster."" 
To sum up, Isakson voted against a filibuster on the background check amendment, backing up his talk of desiring an up-or-down vote on the measure. 
Isakson did eventually vote against the legislation. 
The senator receives a rating of No Flip.

"['Abortion', 'Florida', 'Charles Van Zant']","
Florida Republican says abortion providers have 'reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973'
","
While debating abortion rights, a Republican Florida House member made a startling claim: Doctors who perform abortions are to blame for reducing the African-American population in the United States. 
""In America alone, without the Nazi Holocaust, without the Ku Klux Klan, Planned Parenthood and other abortionists have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973,"" said the House member, Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights. 
Van Zant is sponsoring a bill (HB 845) that would criminalize abortions performed because of the race or sex of the fetus, and during debate, he suggested that abortion groups such as Planned Parenthood are targeting African-Americans. 
Do statistics about the African-American population in the United States support his claim? 
What we found in this case is that Van Zant makes a complicated, and largely unsubstantiated leap of logic. Taken at its most literal meaning, his statement is preposterous. The black population grew by 67 percent, not decreased by 25 percent, from 1973 to 2010, according to U.S. Census figures. 
Interpreting his statement the way Van Zant and other anti-abortion groups intend -- that the U.S. black population would be at least 25 percent higher were it not for Roe v. Wade -- is also fraught with problems. 
To start, federal data for abortions is imprecise, and that’s not even factoring in the additional layer of abortions by race. Van Zant’s claim is largely based on guesstimates. Then there’s the bigger issue of arguing that every fetus would be alive today had the pregnancy not have been aborted, a premise social scientists called over-simplified and inaccurate. 
We’ll take you through it. 
How does Van Zant get there? 
Van Zant’s legislative aide gave us a packet of information relating to his remarks, including print-outs from Abort73.com, an antiabortion advocacy group, on abortion and race. Here, we found a similarly worded version of Van Zant’s claim. 
""From 1973 to 2012, abortion reduced the black population by 30 percent, and that doesn’t even factor in all the children that would have been born to those aborted a generation ago,"" Abort73.com states. 
The website explains how it gets to 30 percent (we’re not vouching for the methodology, mind you): 17 million black babies were aborted since Roe v. Wade (55 million total abortions, as reported by National Right to Life, multiplied by 31 percent, which is what they say is the average rate of abortions by black women since 1973). The black population (people who identified as only black, not a combination of races, to the Census) was around 39 million people in 2010. 
So the black population, once you include 17 million would-be babies, should be 56 million people. 
That’s how they get the talking point. So is it reasonable or accurate? 
Data limitations and manipulations 
The U.S. Census Bureau, not surprisingly, does not come up with projections for what a population would have been without abortions. (We checked.) 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not have a complete record of the number of abortions on black mothers since Roe v. Wade. We knew from the start the agency’s abortion data is incomplete, as not every state reports abortion data to the feds. Florida, for example, reports its abortions but does not break down the mother’s race or age. 
The center, which only started collecting racial/ethnic abortion data from state health departments in 1990, compiled this spreadsheet for us, emphasizing it has many caveats. By the CDC’s count, there have been 39.3 million abortions since 1973. Between 1990 and 2009, 4 million of those were by black women. 
We checked with the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports access to abortion and uses a different method to count abortions. Instead of collecting data from state health departments, the Guttmacher Institute surveys a sample of abortion providers every few years. From 1973 to 2008, the most recent year for which their data is available, nearly 50 million legal abortions occurred in the United States. 
The Guttmacher Institute also does not have a total for abortions by race and ethnicity since 1973, as the group started collecting demographic data of women obtaining abortions in 1994. Their findings do not offer totals, just a proportion of abortions to each racial group. 
In 2008, white women accounted for 36 percent of abortions, black women for 30 percent, Hispanic women for 25 percent and non-Hispanic women of other races for 9 percent, according to Guttmacher’s tally. 
Not so simple 
There is one thing not up for debate: If all of the black women who had abortions had decided to carry their pregnancies to term, there would be more black people alive today. 
But Van Zant’s number is considerably inflated, social scientists told us. 
""The claim that all terminated pregnancies would be alive today is false,"" said Elwood Carlson, a Florida State University sociology professor who specializes in demography for reproductive health, adult mortality and family. 
Some of the pregnancies would have ended by stillbirths and spontaneous abortions, which end an estimated 15 to 20 percent of pregnancies, said Karin Brewster, director of FSU’s Center for Demography and Population Health. 
Plus, black Floridians are twice as likely as white Floridians to have spontaneous pregnancy losses, Carlson said. 
And even among the pregnancies ending with birth, some of those babies would have died as infants. The rate of infant death after live birth is also twice as high for black Floridians as for white Floridians, he said. Further, he said, the risk of involuntary death for black Floridians is twice as high as the risk to white Floridians from conception through adulthood. 
""Induced abortions are only the tip of an iceberg of unequal life chances faced by black citizens of Florida, an iceberg that has been part of life in the state for at least the last half-century and which is showing no signs of drifting away,"" he said. 
Elwood criticized Van Zant for isolating black abortions and not also mentioning there would be more white, Hispanic and Asian citizens if not for abortion. 
Other criticisms from the sources we consulted said it is inappropriate to take correlational data and make causal inferences, and that we don’t know what effect an abortion has on subsequent family planning. Some of the people counted in 2010 may not have been conceived had their mothers elected to carry their first pregnancy. 
Before we close, we’ll point out that Van Zant’s claim does not bolster his case that minority abortions happen because of race, as most abortions are performed because the mother cannot afford a child or having a child would interfere with other responsibilities at work, school or to other children. 
Our ruling 
Van Zant made a fiery case for his bill preventing gender- and race-based abortions, saying abortion providers like Parent Parenthood -- without the Nazis or the KKK --  ""have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973."" 
Van Zant’s statement is wildly incorrect by the most literal measure -- the African-American population has increased since 1973. There’s also problems with the claim if you buy into Van Zant’s logic. Namely, abortion statistics are incomplete and/or difficult to interpret. And there’s no one-to-one correlation between an abortion and the population today. 
We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2013/apr/25/charles-van-zant/florida-republican-says-without-kkk-or-holocaust-a/
"['New Jersey', 'Corporations', 'Taxes', 'Leonard Lance']","
Leonard Lance claims U.S. has highest corporate tax rate in world
","
The United States may lead the rest of the world in a number of areas, but not all of them are positive. 
Rep. Leonard Lance (R-7th Dist.), for example, notes that the nation tops the list when it comes to certain types of taxes. 
""The United States currently has the highest corporate tax rate in the world,"" Lance said in a news release last week that emphasized the need for tax reform. 
PolitiFact New Jersey has tested this claim before, when it was cited twice by state Sen. Joe Kyrillos (R-Monmouth). Kyrillos’ claims were rated Mostly True. 
Lance’s claim hasn’t broken new ground in the six months since Kryillos’ last claim about corporate tax rates. 
Let’s revisit this popular talking point. 
As far as corporate tax rates, the U.S. leads the pack worldwide – but not after factoring in various tax breaks paid by U.S. businesses. 
But first, let’s review the two types of corporate tax rates: statutory rates and effective rates. 
The top statutory corporate tax rate in the United States is 39.1 percent and represents a combination of federal, state and local tax rates imposed by law before any tax breaks are factored into the equation. 
Japan once had the highest combined tax rate in the world, but lowered it in April 2012. That move bumped the United States’ statutory rate to the highest among industrialized nations, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group. 
So the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world in terms of statutory rates. 
Now let’s look at the effective tax rate, which is typically lower than the top statutory rate because of tax breaks. 
In a September 2011 report, the Tax Foundation summarized the findings of the latest 13 studies of effective corporate tax rates across the world. Due to different methodologies, those studies determined U.S. effective tax rates ranged from 23 percent to 34.9 percent, according to the report. 
The United States did not rank first in any of those studies, but in most of them, U.S. effective rates were among the top five highest for the countries analyzed, the report stated. 
Apart from that Tax Foundation report, it’s worth noting that a separate analysis found that 30 Fortune 500 companies, including General Electric, didn’t pay any federal corporate income taxes for the 2008-2010 period. That study was done by the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice along with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. 
So, what’s the better measure -- statutory or effective rates? 
Tax Foundation president Scott Hodge told us previously that statutory rates make for better comparisons. Effective rates are unpredictable and vary across different industries, while statutory rates are fixed, he explained. 
""(The effective tax rate) will differ from industry to industry and business to business, whereas the list price is what it is and everyone starts at that point,"" Hodge said. 
But Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, has argued that ""effective tax rates provide the best measure of comparison for overall tax burdens."" 
Aparna Mathur, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told us for our Kyrillos fact-check on this claim that ""both are equally valid measures of looking at the burden of the corporate income tax."" 
Our ruling 
Lance claimed in a news release, "" The United States currently has the highest corporate tax rate in the world."" 
It’s accurate that, at 39.1 percent, the United States has the highest statutory corporate tax rate among industrialized nations. But with various tax breaks, U.S. effective corporate tax rates range anywhere from 23 percent to 34.9 percent, studies show. 
Those effective tax rates may not land in first place, but they’re still among the highest in the world. 
As we did with Kyrillos’ two claims on this topic, we rate Lance’s claim Mostly True.

"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says he awaits answer from Barack Obama to August 2010 letter on border security
","Gov. Rick Perry says his 2010 plea to President Barack Obama for border security help remains unanswered.

Perry made the appeal to Obama in August 2010 when they met on the airport tarmac in Austin, where Obama was visiting for the day. The governor mentioned the airport meeting when he appeared on CNN’s ""The Situation Room"" on April 5, 2013.

Perry said ""the president hadn't called up the governor of one of the largest states who has the longest border with Mexico and said, ‘Governor, what do you think we need to do about the issue of immigration?’ I would be open to that conversation any day.""

CNN’s Wolf Blitzer replied: ""So if he calls you, are you ready to go to the White House and sit down with the president and try to come up with some sensible solutions to comprehensive immigration reform?""

""Absolutely,"" Perry said. ""As a matter of fact, I handed him a letter some two or three years ago on the tarmac at the Austin airport about that issue, about border security. And yet to get a response.""

At the Aug. 9, 2010, airport encounter, caught on TV cameras, Perry and Obama chatted for less than a minute, according to news stories. Perry ultimately handed his letter on border security to a White House aide, Valerie Jarrett.

In the letter, Perry said he was renewing his invitation for the president and federal officials to meet with Texas officials on security issues. In addition, the letter urged federal drones to be flown along the border and mentioned Perry’s unfulfilled ""standing request"" for 1,000 National Guard troops to work with Texas law enforcement on security operations. Noting the Obama administration’s recently announced plans to send 1,200 National Guard troops to the border, Perry’s letter said the ""deployment of just 286 National Guard personnel along the 1,200-mile Texas-Mexico border is clearly insufficient.""

We asked Perry’s office about the governor not hearing back from Obama. By email, spokesman Josh Havens said: ""We are still waiting on a response from President Obama.""

Then again, Perry fielded a White House response at the time.

Havens simultaneously emailed us a copy of an Aug. 27, 2010, letter to Perry signed by John O. Brennan, then assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. In May 2013, Brennan was sworn in as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Brennan’s letter, on White House letterhead, opened: ""Thank you for your August 9,  2010, letter to President Obama regarding security concerns on our Southwest border. On behalf of President Obama, I wish to assure you that we understand your concerns and appreciate your outreach.""

Brennan’s letter further said that securing the border had been an Obama priority. The letter did not embrace any of Perry’s requests, but noted that a few days after his Austin stop, Obama signed the Southwest Border Security Act into law, enabling the ""addition of substantial and varied law enforcement resources to enhance security on our southern border."" As an example, the letter said, additional National Guard troops and ""other security resources"" would serve. ""It is anticipated that Texas will have over 20 National Guardsmen serving as criminal investigative analysts in fusion centers and over 225 Guardsmen conducting ground surveillance,"" in National Entry Identification Teams the letter said.

The letter closed: ""We are united in our common interest and focused efforts to secure the Southwest border. Your continued engagement and partnership on this national security imperative is much appreciated.""

We emailed the White House and Department of Homeland Security on this topic and did not hear back. We also asked Havens if the governor responded to Brennan’s letter, and we filed an open-records’ request asking the governor’s office for border-related communications between the state and White House since Perry and Obama visited on the tarmac. No materials came our way in the first few days after we submitted the request.

Our ruling

Perry said he had ""yet to get a response"" to his 2010 letter to Obama requesting border security steps.

That’s not so. Perry fielded a reply to his letter from a White House deputy about three weeks after the airport howdy. We grant that it might not have contained the answers Perry sought, but saying Perry has yet to get any response strikes us as both inaccurate and ridiculous.

Association says Texas ranks 49th in per-pupil funding among the states
","
In an advertisement urging lawmakers to fund public education, the Texas Association of School Boards bullets a half dozen claims about the state’s public schools ranging from current student enrollment to a reminder that legislators cut education aid in 2011.

One claim in the ad, which appears online and also filled a page in the April 24, 2013, Austin American-Statesman, was especially familiar--and flawed.

""Now Texas ranks 49th in per-pupil funding among the states,"" the ad said when we looked.

A few days earlier, we rated as Mostly True a similar claim by state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, who like the school boards’ group depended on preliminary spending estimates calculated by the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union. In February 2012, the association said that Texas schools are spending $8,400 per student this year on items such as salaries for school personnel, student transportation, school books and energy. Its breakdown suggests Texas’ per-student expenditures trailed such spending in every state but two.

Those calculations place Texas 48th among the states in per-student spending.

And how might someone conclude, like the school boards’ association, that Texas ranks 49th?  The compiled figures, shown on Summary Table K in the association’s report, downloadable here, reflect spending within each state plus schools in the District of Columbia, which has current estimated expenditures of more than $14,000 per student. Consequently, the Texas spending level falls 49th among the 50 states plus D.C. 
By phone, Catherine Clark, associate executive director of the school boards’ association, confirmed that the group relied on the NEA calculations in declaring Texas as 49th in education spending among the states. If spending in the D.C. schools figures into that conclusion, Clark said, ""then we’re wrong.""

Our ruling

The group said Texas ranks 49th in per-pupil funding among the states.

Texas ranks 48th among the states, according to preliminary figures, and 49th only if one also considers spending in the schools in Washington, D.C., which is not a state.

This claim is close to accurate, but without the D.C. clarification, it rates as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/24/texas-association-school-boards/association-says-texas-ranks-49th-pupil-funding-am/

Dan Patrick says 315,000 “mostly minority” Texas students are enrolled in failing schools
","
Advocating a bill he introduced to help public school students pay for private school, state Sen. Dan Patrick said in an April 9, 2013, committee hearing, ""We have 315,000 mostly minority students in failing schools."" 
The Houston Republican’s Senate Bill 23 would provide a tax credit to businesses that donate to a private school scholarship fund. 
Since he and Lt. Gov. Dewhurst announced the plan in December 2012, they have referred to the plight of students in schools rated academically unacceptable. In the April 9 hearing, Patrick spoke of ""trapping a poor student in a poor-performing school -- of which we have 532 in our state, out of 8,500 campuses."" 
Overall, about 70 percent of Texas’ 5 million students in 2011-12 belonged to groups traditionally considered minorities, according to 2011-12 Texas Education Agency data. 
We wondered how the picture changed when looking only at students in schools rated unacceptable. 
Patrick’s chief of staff, Logan Spence, sent us a spreadsheet from the education agency showing 2011-12 enrollment data for 530 schools rated unacceptable, the lowest category in the state’s most recent accountability ratings, which are from 2011. No rulings were issued in 2012, as the state is phasing out TAKS (Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills) tests and replacing them with STAAR (State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness) exams. 
Via email, agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe verified the numbers for us and said that the tally of campuses rated unacceptable had fluctuated as schools appealed ratings, ending up at 530. 
By our calculations using the agency’s data, the number of nonwhite students in ""unacceptable"" schools was 315,073 in 2010-11, but 304,139 in 2011-12. 
Spence told us Patrick has used totals from both years in speeches. 
We calculated that non-white students made up 77.8 percent of the enrollment at ""unacceptable"" schools in 2010-11 and 78.4 percent of the enrollment at ""unacceptable"" schools in 2011-12. 
The breakdown for 2011-12 enrollment at schools rated unacceptable, using the agency’s categories: 
Hispanic -- 51.4 percent 
At schools rated acceptable or better in 2011-12, we found, the enrollment was 68.5 percent non-white. And those schools accounted for the vast majority of Texas’ 4.98 million students in 2011-12. Schools rated acceptable or better served 91.4 percent of Texas students, including 91 percent of the state’s 3.4 million non-white students. 
Again using the agency’s data, we broke out the percentage of non-white students for the other school rating levels, and found that the percentage of non-white students decreased with each step up: 
  
Our ruling 
Patrick said Texas has ""315,000 mostly minority students in failing schools."" 
That matches an outdated figure -- the 2010-11 non-white population at such schools. For 2011-12, there were 304,139 students in ""unacceptable"" schools. In both cases, about 78 percent of the students in the faltering schools were ""minority,"" meaning non-white. In contrast, schools rated acceptable or better in 2011-12 had enrollments of nearly 69 percent non-white students. 

We rate Patrick’s statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/24/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-315000-mostly-minority-texas-stud/

Rep. Marcia Fudge cites wage gap between Ohio women and men
","
Wedged between April Fools Day and the April 15 tax filing deadline is a lesser- known April milestone that feminist and labor groups, the U.S. Department of Labor and the White House  are eager to publicize. By their reckoning, April 9 is the day when female wage earners catch up to the amount of money their higher-earning male counterparts collected during the previous year. They refer to it as Equal Pay Day. 
Numerous politicians noted the occasion this year by issuing press releases.  President Obama issued a presidential proclamation.  Warrensville Heights Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge decried earnings disparities on her Facebook page, where she cited an analysis of the wage gap produced by the National Partnership on Women and Families and a study by the American Association of University Women in saying: ""Women in Ohio earn on average 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man."" 
Fudge accurately relayed the data released by those groups, but how accurate was their material? Data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which the groups relied on, show the 77 percent pay gap percent figure they cited, but an October 2012 report  on women’s earnings from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated a smaller wage gap for Ohio: 83.6 percent. 
According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the varied pay gap assessments are due to differences in how each agency conducts its measurements. The Census Bureau and women’s groups look at differences in annual earnings, while the BLS examines earnings on a weekly basis. 
""Analyzing the weekly figures can be more precise in certain ways, like accounting for work hours that vary over the course of the year, and less accurate in others, like certain forms of compensation that don’t get paid as weekly wages,"" the Labor Department said last year in a blog entry on the pay gap. ""No matter which number you start with, the differences in pay for women and men really add up. "" 
The National Partnership for Women and Families decided to use Census Bureau material in examining the annual median earnings for full-time, year-round workers because ""it has the longest history and it is the most frequently cited data,"" according to the group‘s director of workplace fairness, Sarah Crawford. Crawford said BLS’ weekly earnings data includes some workers who work full-time, but not all year, excludes the self-employed, and also underestimates earnings from yearly bonuses. 
PolitiFact has made several examinations of the claim that women earn 76 to 77 percent as much as men, and found that they lacked context because they failed to account for factors like education, type of job, age of employee and experience level. For example, an October study by the American Association of University Women, which advocates for equality for women and girls, analyzed men’s and women’s salaries a year after graduation from college. It found a wage gap in almost all occupations, but concluded it was a smaller 6.6 percent when qualifiers like education, training, age, and parental status were taken into account. That gap could be attributed to gender discrimination and women’ ability to negotiate salaries, the report found .An AAAU researcher noted the wage gap can grow as careers progress. 
Fudge is right that there’s a gap in pay between men and women, though the size of that gap depends on the statistics one consults. We rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/24/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-cites-wage-gap-between-ohio-women/

Union chief criticizes days spent on testing
","
Last month, 35 people, including former Superintendent Beverly Hall, were indicted for their alleged roles in a widespread test cheating scandal at Atlanta Public Schools. The educators are accused of a mix of charges involving altering -- or pressuring other educators to alter -- standardized test scores. Some of the accused then accepted bonus money based on the falsified test results. 
As the long line of defendants made the perp walk into the county jail, critics of standardized testing policies noted that scandals like Atlanta’s probably resulted partially from the pressure to succeed on standardized tests. 
""Standardized tests have a role in accountability, but today they dominate everything else and too often don’t even correlate to what students need to know to succeed,"" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union, in a statement. ""It is outrageous that schools in some states are spending up to 100 days a year doing test-prep or actual testing."" 
With students spending fewer than 200 days in school (Georgia requires at least 180 days in school; the national average requirement is about 178 days), the union chief’s claim could mean more than half the school year is spent on testing. 
PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Weingarten’s number was correct and decided to take a closer look. 
Weingarten’s and the AFT’s spokesman, Scott Stephens, told us that the union chief’s statement was based on both factual reports as well as anecdotal evidence from the organization’s 1.5 million members nationwide. ""While 100 days is on the high end, it’s clear that in many states, ‘up to 100 days’ is a pretty good estimate,"" he said. 
Stephens cited two reports to back up Weingarten’s claim. The first, from the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, includes findings from the Wisconsin Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development about the amount of time spent on testing in general and for students with special needs. The Wisconsin association found that Wisconsin teachers spent a per-district average of 976 hours administering tests. The data in that report is based on information collected in the 2005-2006 school year, and uses cumulative numbers instead of breaking down the information into the time spent per district or per school. 
The second report is a 2012 white paper by the Central Florida Public School Board Coalition. The group found that in Florida, students will spend at minimum nine weeks in kindergarten and up to 21 weeks of the school year in 10th grade on testing. Twenty-one, five-day weeks equate to 105 days, which satisfies Weingarten’s claim. 
Based on the data some school districts have presented, Weingarten’s claim is correct, said Robert Schaeffer, public education director for the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, also known as FairTest. That group has also been critical of standardized tests for the time and expense required by educators and school systems to administer them. 
Schaeffer’s organization does not track standardized testing days nationally, but has supported legislation in states like Washington, requiring school systems to post testing schedules so parents can see how much testing must be done. 
It is important to note that the testing numbers included in the studies are cumulative numbers. Not all students take the same tests at every grade level. And not all tests are administered the same number of days. Also some of the tests, like end-of-year exams, can be taken multiple times by some students, which would also impact the data. 
PolitiFact Texas has examined similar claims and found that statements made about the amount of standardized testing mandated for school systems was exaggerated, as not all grades or all students took tests on each of designated testing days. 
Test preparation is broad and could be considered everyday classroom standards, said Matt Cardoza, spokesman for the Georgia Department of Education. Test preparation can also differ by school. 
For example, Georgia administers three basic standardized tests. Simply adding up the available testing windows for the three easily exceeds 100 days, but provides a misleading statistic. Although the test windows cover numerous days, actual test administration days are much fewer. All three tests are not administered to all students on each available day. Also key, the tests do not take all day to complete. 
Unfortunately, there is no good, reliable national data involving this part of standardized testing, said Tom Loveless, director of the Brookings Institution’s Brown Center on Education Policy. (The Council of Chief State School Officers no longer tracks the data.) 
Also, what is designated as test prep can vary between educators, and could be construed as almost anything taught during the school year, as opposed to skills that would not regularly be taught, Loveless said. 
""And I think (Weingarten’s) statement points to an extreme example using questionable sources of evidence,"" he said. ""The statement is quite vague and an exaggeration."" 
So does the union chief’s claim get a passing grade? 
Weingarten said that schools in some states are spending up to 100 days a year doing test-prep or actual testing. 
Upon initial review, basic testing calendars from some school districts bear out the claim. But a deeper delve into the data finds that not all students in each district take each test, tests are not administered each day during the multi-day testing windows, and in some cases, the tests do not cover an entire day. 
Weingarten allowed herself some latitude by using broad phrasing, such as ""some districts"" and ""up to 100 days"" in her claim. But the thrust of her statement is misleading, according to education experts. 
Weingarten’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. 
We rated the claim Mostly False.

Chris Smith says elections bill has only two required changes
","
Florida lawmakers are poised to pass voting law changes after being mocked for long lines and delayed results during the 2012 presidential election. 
But in the waning days of the legislative session, Senate Democrats are criticizing the plan as not going far enough to address the problems at the polls last year. 
""This bill mandates only two things that will address concerns from the last election,"" wrote Sen. Chris Smith, the Senate Democratic leader from Fort Lauderdale, in a column in the Sun-Sentinel April 21. ""It allows persons to correct an absentee ballot if they did not sign it and requires an extra two hours a day for early voting. Everything else in this bill is discretionary. Under SB 600, Broward, Dade, Palm Beach, Duval, Orange, Hillsborough, Jackson, Franklin, Dixie and all the rest of our 67 counties can do exactly what they did in 2012, with the exception of just two more hours per day for early voting. Nothing else is mandated. Nothing else is changed."" 
The column left readers with the impression that the bill changed little for the better. Smith called it ""an opportunity lost."" 
Democrats and Republicans are split on some provisions of the bill, so there are varying perspectives as to what ""concerns"" came up after the last election. We wanted to fact-check Smith’s claim that the election bill ""allows persons to correct an absentee ballot if they did not sign it and requires an extra two hours a day for early voting. Everything else in this bill is discretionary."" 
Inside the elections bills 
First, some quick history. In 2011, the GOP-dominated Legislature passed an elections law that reduced the amount of days for early voting from 14 to eight. The new law gave supervisors a choice of offering between between six and 12 hours of early voting each day. So local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days. 
Gov. Rick Scott signed the 2011 elections bill but distanced himself from it after Florida’s 2012 election drew national ridicule. Scott announced his own recommendations for reform that echoed proposals from the state elections supervisors association. 
On April 16, the Florida Senate reworked the House elections bill, HB 7013. The Senate is scheduled to take a final vote on its version of the bill on April 24, after which it will go back to the House. We read the bill and interviewed elections officials, lawmakers involved in crafting the bill and Senate staff to analyze what the bill will and won’t do. 
Let’s look at the two changes Smith mentioned. 
Absentee ballot signatures: The bill gives voters a second chance if they forgot to sign their absentee ballot. The bill says they would have until 5 p.m. the Sunday before Election Day to correct it. 
Adds early voting hours: Currently, the law for early voting requires eight days and between six to 12 hours a day for a combined 48 to 96 hours. The proposed law would create between 64 hours (eight days, 8 hours each) and 168 hours (14 days, 12 hours each) at the discretion of elections supervisors. Smith said the law would mandate an extra two hours a day of early voting. That’s true -- counties that had six hours would now have to increase it to at least eight. 
Still, Smith wants elections supervisors to offer 168 hours, even though many said that would be too demanding and unnecessary, especially in smaller counties and primary elections. Smith wants voters in all counties to have the same access to the polls. 
""I dont give a damn. This is voting. This is a fundamental right,"" Smith told PolitiFact Florida. ""This is what people have died in the streets for, this is what people are dying overseas for. Just because an elected official doesn't want to do their job, maybe they shouldn't be supervisor of elections."" 
The elections supervisors’ association wrote a letter endorsing SB 600 as ""an excellent election reform bill."" The association had two top priorities of equal weight: reducing the ballot length and expanding options for early voting sites and hours. 
Smith’s claim that the bill only mandates an extra two hours a day of early voting is factually correct, but it doesn’t tell the whole story, said Brian Corley, Pasco County’s elections supervisor and leader of the association’s legislative affairs this year. (Corley is a Republican; his association includes supervisors from both parties.) 
The association was not seeking a one-size-fits-all mandate to expand hours because large counties may need more hours than smaller counties, he said. 
""Do you think (Palm Beach supervisor Susan) Bucher or (Broward supervisor Brenda) Snipes in Broward for a major presidential or gubernatorial election is really going to have 64 hours?"" he said. ""The answer is obviously no."" 
Let’s look at some of the other provisions that would change in election law: 
Early voting sites: The bill says supervisors ""may"" offer early voting at fairgrounds, civic centers, courthouses, community centers and stadiums. The supervisors don’t have to offer early voting at these places, so it’s not a mandate. Current law allows for early voting only at libraries, city halls and elections offices. 
Election preparation report: Every supervisor must submit a report three months before Election Day about staffing and equipment. 
Declaring elections supervisors noncompliant: The Senate added a controversial amendment that allows the state to place elections supervisors in ""noncompliant status"" if they miss deadlines or violate election rules. Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami, sponsored that amendment, which appears to be aimed at counties deemed ""underperforming"" in the 2012 election by the state including Miami-Dade and Broward. 
Supervisors declared noncompliant would lose their ""special qualification salary"" -- the extra $2,000 supervisors can earn if they meet certain criteria. Most of a supervisor’s salary is based on a population formula. About half of the supervisors are currently eligible to receive the $2,000. 
Voter assistance/ballot brokering: One of the more contentious additions to the bill limits the number of voters a volunteer can assist in an election to 10 people. Further, the voter must know the person assisting him or her before casting a ballot. The bill also limits the number of absentee ballots that paid campaign workers and other solicitors can accept for nonfamily members to two. 
Voter rights groups attacked the changes as disenfranchising the elderly, disabled voters and non-English speakers. The proposal follows an election in which paid ballot brokers in Miami-Dade, known as boleteros, were arrested. 
Length of ballot items: Republicans included a 75-word limit on ballot summaries of proposed constitutional amendments that come from the Legislature. 
Supervisors are pleased this language is in the proposed overhaul. Democrats are displeased because the 75-word limit disappears if the Florida Supreme Court rejects the wording of the ballot summary. Democrats wanted an amendment that limited the summaries to 75 words on all attempts, but Republicans said no. 
Corley is not worried. He said, ""Could there be a scenario where the Attorney General goes above 75 words in a rewrite? Sure it could, logistically. But I don’t see 650 words."" 
Sunday voting: Smith’s column doesn’t mention that the bill would allow voting on the Sunday before Election Day, known as ""Souls to the Polls"" drives in some black communities. Current law bans early voting on that Sunday. 
Before the 2011 law, supervisors could offer an aggregate of eight hours for early voting on the Saturday and Sunday before the election. Just 10 of 67 counties offered voting on Sunday in the 2010 general election for no more than four hours, including Pinellas and Miami-Dade. 
The new proposal allows -- but doesn’t mandate -- eight to 12 hours of early voting on this Sunday. 
The law contains other mandates for supervisors, including requiring them to notify electors the reason their absentee ballot was rejected and to upload early voting and absentee ballots the day before Election Day (but not publicly post it). 
Smith told PolitiFact Florida in an interview that his comment referred to ""things that affect voters and their time in line."" He called the measures that affect supervisors and canvassing boards ""inside baseball."" 
Our ruling 
Smith wrote that the election bill ""allows persons to correct an absentee ballot if they did not sign it and requires an extra two hours a day for early voting. Everything else in this bill is discretionary."" 
The bill does mandate those two changes. But Smith omits that some of those discretionary changes in the bill are a big deal and are expected to change how elections are operated in large counties. Elections supervisors in at least some counties are likely to restore early voting on the Sunday before Election Day and they are likely to add more early voting sites and go beyond the mandated minimum hours. Plus, we found a few provisions that are not discretionary and would affect voters.

"['Immigration', 'Drugs', 'Terrorism', 'Texas', 'Louie Gohmert']","
Louie Gohmert says al Qaeda has camps with drug cartels in Mexico
"," A Texas congressman stressing border security told an interviewer that a terrorist group is set up south of the Rio Grande.

Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, said on C-SPAN’s ""Washington Journal"" April 17, 2013: ""We know al Qaeda has camps over with the drug cartels on the other side of the Mexican border. We know that people are now being trained to come in and act like Hispanic when they’re radical Islamists. We know these things are happening and... it’s just insane not to protect ourselves.""

We wondered about al Qaeda having camps with the Mexican drug cartels.

Gohmert's basis To our inquiry, Gohmert spokeswoman Kimberly Willingham noted a 2006 interim report and November 2012 follow-up report, ""A Line in the Sand: Countering Crime, Violence and Terror at the Southwest Border,"" prepared by the Republican staff of a subcommittee to the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee that was chaired by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin.

Both reports say terrorists can cross the U.S.-Mexico border, though neither mentions al Qaeda camps in Mexico. More recently, McCaul suggested that a foiled assassination plot involving an Iranian American resident of Round Rock, north of Austin, suggests a growing link between Mideast terrorist groups and organized crime in Mexico. Manssor Arbabsiar pleaded guilty in October 2012 to participating in a scheme to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States after attempting to hire a hit man Arbabsiar believed to be a member of the Zetas Mexican drug cartel; the assassin was actually a paid Drug Enforcement Administration informant.

McCaul, who now chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a December 2012 Austin American-Statesman interview that Iran and Mideast militant groups such as Hezbollah have long had money laundering and fundraising hubs across Latin America and the Texas-tied plot reflected ""the first time we have seen that financial relationship become potentially operational."" McCaul also told the newspaper: ""It is not a real stretch of the imagination that these groups could work together operationally if they already have a financial relationship. Mexican cartels don't want to get into the terrorism business, and I think to a large extent that may be true, but I think the lesson of 9/11 was to connect the dots.""

McCaul also said he would focus the committee on drawing attention to the threat of such emerging partnerships and keeping narco-terrorist operatives from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

The 2006 report overseen by McCaul, referencing a February 2003 report by the Library of Congress, says: ""Statements made by high-ranking Mexican officials prior to and following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks indicate that one or more Islamic terrorist organizations has sought to establish a presence in Mexico. In May 2001, former Mexican National security adviser and ambassador to the United Nations, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, reported, that ‘Spanish and Islamic terrorist groups are using Mexico as a refuge.’""

The Library of Congress report says there was  speculation in Mexico after the 2001 attacks that ""al Qaeda cells could be present in Mexico and could potentially attempt to cross the U.S. southwest border to conduct additional attacks."" During an October 2001 United Nations conference, according to the report, the director of Mexico’s Center for Intelligence and National Security, Eduardo Medina Mora, said the possibility of an al Qaeda attack against the United States launched from Mexico ""could not be ruled out,"" though Medina Mora also said the center had no reason to believe that there was an al Qaeda presence in Mexico, the report says.

Testimony by federal officials The 2006 report says the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert Mueller, confirmed in testimony that there are individuals from countries with known al Qaeda connections ""who are changing their Islamic surnames to Hispanic-sounding names and obtaining false Hispanic identities, learning to speak Spanish and pretending to be Hispanic immigrants.""

We perused Mueller’s March 8, 2005 testimony to a House subcommittee, downloaded via Nexis, seeing no mention of al Qaeda camps in Mexico or links to Mexican drug cartels.

Rep. John Culberson, R-Houston, asked Mueller if he was aware of individuals from countries with al Qaeda connections entering the United States using false identities, in particular changing Islamic surnames to Hispanic surnames. ""We’ve had indications of that,"" Mueller replied, adding that he would have to check on instances of somebody from, say, a Middle Eastern country adopting an Hispanic name and attempting to enter the country.

""I'm not certain how many instances there might have been,"" Mueller testified. ""I can tell you that we are concerned, that Homeland Security is concerned about special interest aliens coming into the United States. We work closely with the Border Patrol and"" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ""to interview those when they're apprehended. We have ongoing investigations together into smuggling organizations that may be assisting in getting special interest aliens cross the border.""

By phone, FBI spokeswoman Kathy Wright told us she was unaware of any FBI statements specific to al Qaeda having camps in Mexico with the drug cartels. Also, she said, ""it’s not our practice to release information like that.""

Weeks before Mueller testified, according to a Feb. 17, 2005, New York Times news story, Adm. James M. Loy, the deputy secretary of Homeland Security, said in written testimony that al Qaeda operatives had considered using the Mexican border as an entry point. But, the Times said, Loy said that there was ""currently no conclusive evidence"" that this had succeeded.

Other news reports Our search of recent news accounts turned up nothing specific to al Qaeda camps in Mexico, though an Oct. 13, 2011, Agence France Press news story, datelined Mexico City, said that in February 2011, Janet Napolitano, the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security, had said U.S. authorities were concerned about a potential alliance between groups like al Qaeda and the Zetas, which the story described as the cartel ""started by elite military brass who went bad to sell drugs.""

Napolitano mentioned the worry, according to the transcript of a Feb. 9, 2011, hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security, after Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Corpus Christi, said that he believed terrorists could exploit the international drug trade to the detriment of the United States.

""Indeed,"" Napolitano replied. ""And one of the things that -- all I will say in open setting is that we have for some time been thinking ahead about what would happen if, say, al Qaeda were to unite with the Zetas, one of the drug cartels. And I'll just leave it at that.""

The Agence France Press story also said that President Barack Obama said in July 2011 that the Zetas ""were a threat to international security, comparing them to organized crime groups in Italy and Japan. But experts argued,"" the story said, that ""it is one thing for the Zetas to indulge in cross-border business, and it is quite another for them to decide to take part in a terror strike that would directly challenge and confront the U.S. government.""

Experts say such camps unheard of Next, several security experts on security issues each told us he was unaware of al Qaeda camps in Mexico.

""Never heard this one before,"" replied Daniel Byman, a Georgetown University professor and the director of research at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. ""This was a post 9/11 fear, but I never saw evidence for it. ""

By telephone, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that he would not discount border security, but Gohmert’s claim struck him as ""incredibly sloppy. It doesn’t help the debate. We don’t know that these claims are true.""

Gartenstein-Ross offered, too, that it would be foolish for the drug cartels to let al Qaeda establish camps in their bailiwicks. The cartels, he said, ""are out to make money. Right now, they have not drawn the (direct) wrath of the United States. If they had al Qaeda camps,"" he said, they’d draw U.S. military might.

""There has been no credible report of al Qaeda having camps with the drug cartels,"" he said.

Similarly, Brian Michael Jenkins, a RAND terrorism expert, said through an email that he has not seen any evidence to support the claim. A RAND colleague, political scientist Peter Chalk, separately said via email he had not heard of such camps in Mexico. Our ruling

Gohmert told C-SPAN that al Qaeda has camps with the drug cartels in Mexico.

Since 9/11, there has been occasional speculation about al Qaeda operatives crossing into the country from Mexico. Notably, too, Napolitano said in 2011 that the U.S. government has thought about what would happen if the Zetas united with al Qaeda.

However, there appears to be no evidence of al Qaeda now having camps in Mexico, with the drug cartels or otherwise.

We rate this claim as False.",/factchecks/2013/apr/23/louie-gohmert/louie-gohmert-says-al-qaeda-has-camps-drug-cartels/

Rep. Peter King says alleged Boston bombers are fifth terrorists to survive prior U.S. scrutiny
","
Several days after the capture of Dzokhar Tsarnaev, one of two brothers suspected in the Boston Marathon bombing, U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., cited a pattern in which the U.S. government looks into suspicious individuals who later are charged with terrorist acts. 
According to media reports, the FBI has acknowledged interviewing Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- Dzokhar’s older brother, who died while fleeing the police -- at the request of Russian officials in 2011. ""After looking at his phone records, websites he visited and associates, the FBI found he had no ties to terror,"" ABC News reported. (We should note for the record that Dzokhar Tsarnaev has yet to face trial in the bombing case, so a court has not yet ruled on his guilt or innocence.) 
In an April 22, 2013, interview on MSNBC, King -- a senior Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee and the House Intelligence Committee -- said that pattern sounded familiar. 
The Boston Marathon bombing ""is the fifth case I'm aware of where a person was brought to the attention of the FBI. ... The FBI examined them and felt they were no threat and they went on to carry out terrorist murders."" 
We checked with King’s office, and a spokesman confirmed the four previous examples he was referring to: Anwar al-Awlaki, David Headley, Abdulhakim Muhammed and Nidal Hasan. Here’s a summary of their cases. 
• Anwar al-Awlaki. Al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born citizen of Yemeni descent, was hunted by the U.S. and killed in a drone strike in September 2011. He was reportedly a key adviser, and even an instigator, in several terrorist incidents involving U.S. targets, including the 2009 killing of 13 and wounding of more than 30 by a shooter at Fort Hood, Texas; the 2009 plot to explode a plane in Detroit using an ""underwear"" bomb; and the foiled attempt to plant a bomb in New York City’s Times Square in 2010. 
By the time of his death, Al-Awlaki ""had been under the scrutiny of American officials for more than a decade,"" the New York Times reported. ""He first came under FBI investigation in 1999 because of associations with militants and was questioned after the 2001 terrorist attacks about his contacts with three of the hijackers at his mosques in San Diego and Virginia."" 
• David Headley. Headley, a Pakistani-American born as Daood Gilani, is serving a 35-year sentence for helping organize scouting missions for a 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, India, that left 160 dead. In the late 1990s, Headley had served as a confidential informant for the Drug Enforcement Agency and was sent on one mission to Lahore, Pakistan, in which he infiltrated heroin trafficking networks. 
But later, his actions raised questions among friends and acquaintances. ""A former girlfriend of Headley’s told a bartender named Terry O’Donnell that he wanted to go to Pakistan to fight alongside Islamic militants,"" ProPublica reported, adding that O’Donnell subsequently contacted an FBI-led task force that was investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. On Oct. 4, 2001, ""two Defense Department agents working for the task force questioned him in front of his DEA handlers at the drug agency’s office."" 
• Abdulhakim Muhammed. Muhammed, a convert to Islam who was born Carlos Bledsoe, pled guilty to killing Pvt. William Long and wounding Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula outside a U.S. Army recruiting station in Little Rock, Ark., in 2009. He is now serving life in prison. 
Muhammed had been under investigation by the FBI's Joint Terrorist Task Force. ""The investigation was in its preliminary stages, authorities said, and was based on the suspect's travel to Yemen and his arrest there for using a Somali passport,"" ABC News reported. ABC also reported that his ""travel within the United States had also come under scrutiny by the Terrorist Task Force, including travel to Columbus, Ohio – an area of domestic concern for authorities who have observed a number of Somali Americans traveling from there to Somali to wage jihad."" 
• Nidal Hasan. Hasan, a psychiatrist and major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, is the only suspect in the Fort Hood shootings and is awaiting a military trial that could bring the death penalty. 
Prior to the shootings, the government intercepted at least 18 emails between Hasan and al-Awlaki. They were ""passed along to two Joint Terrorism Task Force cells led by the FBI, but a senior defense official said no one at the Defense Department knew about the messages until after the shootings,"" the Associated Press reported.  
The FBI and military officials offered divergent reasons for the failure to pass along the messages. ""FBI officials have said a military investigator on the task force saw the emails and looked up Hasan's record, but finding nothing particularly worrisome, the investigator neither sought nor got permission to pass the emails on to other military officials,"" the AP reported. A senior defense official countered that ""the rules of the task force prevented that military representative from passing the records on without approval from other members of the task force."" 
One additional case shares some aspects of the pattern King laid out -- that of Umar Farook Abdulmutallab, the ""underwear bomber."" But since his plot was foiled and he did not go on to ""carry out terrorist murders,"" his case doesn’t make King’s list. (In Abdulmutallab’s case, the National Security Agency had intercepted a discussion in Yemen that referenced the plot, but analysts did not link these intercepts with a separate piece of information, that Adbulmutallab’s father ""visited the United States Embassy in Nigeria to express concerns about his son’s radicalization,"" according to the New York Times.) 
We asked Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert who is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, for his thoughts on King’s list. He agreed that Hasan’s case qualified as a good example of government officials determining (misguidedly, as it turned out) that an individual was ""no threat."" He added that he thought Al-Awlaki and Muhammed fit the pattern to a significant degree, but not entirely. In their cases, while the U.S. government did not immediately step in to arrest either man, it’s not clear that the U.S. government went so far as to determine that they were ""no threat,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. 
The weakest example, Gartenstein-Ross said, is Headley, whose case is murky for several reasons, including his role as a U.S. government informant. Seven years elapsed between his interview in 2001 and the Mumbai attack in 2008 -- a long enough time to raise questions about whether he was sufficiently radicalized to have given government officials reason to believe he was on a path to terrorism. 
Our ruling 
King said the Boston Marathon bombing ""is the fifth case"" in which U.S. government officials examined individuals potentially involved in terrorism ""and felt they were no threat and they went on to carry out terrorist murders."" 
It’s clear that there are at least four prior instances -- Anwar al-Awlaki, David Headley, Abdulhakim Muhammed and Nidal Hasan -- that fit the pattern of someone being on the government’s radar screen and later allegedly committing terrorist acts. But in at least one of these cases, and to a lesser extent two others, it’s not clear that the government determined that the individuals ""were no threat"" based on the initial round of scrutiny. On balance, we rate King’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/23/peter-king/rep-peter-king-says-alleged-boston-bombers-are-fif/
